there more irrational numbers than rational numbers  or more rational numbers than irrational numbers  well  there are infinitely many of both  so the question doesnâ  t make sense  it turns out  however  that the set of rational numbers is infinite in a very different way from the set of irrational numbers  itâ  s countable  in mathematics an infinite set is called countable if we can put its members into one to one correspondence with the natural numbers   1      2      3    â    for example  a bag with infinitely many apples would be a countable infinity because  given an infinite amount of time  we can label the apples   1      2      3    â   and so on  we can do the same for the rational numbers  all presented as reduced fractions   first  write down all rationals whose denominator and numerator add up to   2    thereâ  s only one of them    1 1 1    next list all rationals with denominator and numerator add up to   3    there are only   1 2   and   2 1    then write down those for which the sum is   4      5      6    and so on  this is an unfailing recipe to list all the rationals  and once they are listed we can label them by the natural numbers   1      2      3    â    the same isnâ  t true of the irrational numbers  they form an uncountably infinite set  in 1873 the mathematician georg cantor came up with a beautiful and elegant proof of this fact  first notice that when we put the rational numbers and the irrational numbers together we get all the real numbers  each number on the line is either rational or irrational  if the irrational numbers were countable  just as the rationals are  then the real numbers would be countable tooâ  itâ  s not too hard to convince ourselves of that  so letâ  s suppose the real numbers are countable  so that we can make a list of them  for example    0 1234567 dots     1 4367892 dots     2 3987851 dots     3 7891234 dots     4 1415695 dots    and so on  with every real number occurring somewhere in the infinite list  now take the first digit after the decimal point of the first number  the second digit after the decimal point of the second number  the third digit after the decimal point of the third number  and so on  to get a new number   0 13816 dots    now change each digit of this new number  for example by adding   1    this gives the new number   0 24927 dots    this new number is not the same as the first number on the list  because their first decimal digits are different  neither is it the same as the second number on the list  because their second decimal digits are different  carrying on like this shows that the new number is different from every single number on the list  and so it cannot appear anywhere in the list  but we started with the assumption that every real number was on the list  the only way to avoid this contradiction is to admit that the assumption that the real numbers are countable is false  and this then also implies that the irrational numbers are uncountable  itâ  s easy to see that an uncountable infinity is â  biggerâ   than a countable one  an uncountable infinity can form a continuum  such as the number line  in a way that a countable infinity canâ  t  cantor went on to define all sorts of other infinities too  one bigger than the other  with the countable infinity at the bottom of the hierarchy  when he first published these ideas  cantor faced strong opposition from some of his colleagues  one of them  henri poincarã   described cantorâ  s ideas as a â  grave diseaseâ   and another  leopold kronecker  went so far as to denounce cantor as a â  scientific charlatanâ   and â  corrupter of youthâ    cantor suffered severe mental health problems which may have resulted in part from the rejection his work had met with  but we now know that his work had simply come too soon  150 years on  cantorâ  s ideas form a central pillar of mathematics and many of his results can be found in standard textbooks       printables

of morally sound behaviour  indeed the very word â  mathematicsâ    which translates as â  that which is learnedâ    has been attributed to pythagoras  the pythagoreans were fond of numbers  whole numbers to be precise  they believed that everything in the universe could be expressed in terms of whole numbers and the ratios between them  the fractions  it was one unfortunate pythagorean  hippasus of metapontum  who discovered that this is not the case  in fact  even the simplest of geometrical objects  the length of the diagonal of a square of side length   1    is an irrational number  namely    sqrt 2     historical evidence is conflicting  but it seems that the pythagoreans punished hippasus severely for his discovery  according to some sources he was expelled from the

you an accuracy of   1   part in   10000    in the 1960s  however  the meteorologist edward lorenz discovered that it does matterâ  a lot  lorenz was running computer simulations of the weather  given initial values that describe the weather today  the simulation would chomp through calculations that gave the corresponding values for tomorrow  the day after  and so on  these were the early days of computing  so his model wasnâ  t sophisticated enough to predict the real weather accurately  nevertheless  lorenz was pleased with his approach  seeing that it turned out realistic looking weather patterns  one day he decided to run the same simulation twice  rather than starting from the very beginning again  he took the numbers that the first one had produced half way through and fed them in

there is   1  frac 1  2    3 2    and so on  in fact  there are infinitely many fractions between any two whole numbers  letâ  s see why  between   0   and   1   there are also    frac 1  3        frac 1  4        frac 1  5     and any number that can be written as    frac 1  n    where   n   is some whole number  in addition there are fractions like    frac 2  3        frac 3  4        frac 4  5     and so on  more generally  if   m   and   n   are positive whole numbers and   m   is smaller than   n    then    frac m  n    is a rational number that lies between   0   and   1    in a similar way  there are also infinitely many fractions in between any other pair of whole numbers  numbers that can be written as fractions are called rational numbers  these include the whole numbers  since a whole number can be written as a fraction with   1   in the denominator    1  frac 1  1       2  frac 2  1     and so on  and as we have just seen  there are not only infinitely many rational numbers in the whole number line  but there are also infinitely many rational numbers in just the small interval between two consecutive whole numbers  but we can go even further than this  if you give me any two rational numbers   x   and   y   on the number line  then no matter how close together they are  i can always find infinitely many other rational numbers that lie between them  one way of doing this is as follows  imagine all the numbers as lying along a ruler  suppose you have given me   x    frac 1  100    and   y   frac 2  100     the two are very close together  the difference   d   is   d   y x   frac 2  100     frac 1  100     frac 1  100     the difference   d   is the length of the little interval that lies between   x   and   y   on the ruler  now suppose i chop that little interval between   x   and   y   in half  the number   z   that corresponds to the midpoint obviously lies between   x   and   y    the distance from   x   to that number   z   is    frac 1  100   times  frac 1  2     frac 1  200     so the number   z   is   z   x  frac 1  200     frac 1  100   frac 1  200     frac 3  100      chopping the interval between   x   and   y   in half gives a new number   z   which is also a rational number   it is also a rational number  since it can be written as a fraction  any sum or product of two rational numbers is always itself a rational number  since when you add or multiply two fractions you always get another fraction  so i have just found you a rational number   z   that lies in between   x   and   y    but i could find infinitely many others in the same way  rather than chopping the distance in half  i could have chopped it in three  four  five  a hundred  or any number   n   of pieces  giving me   n   little intervals  the distance from   x   to the right endpoint   z   of the first interval is then    frac 1  100   times  frac 1  n     the point   z   itself is   z   x  frac 1  n     frac 1  100   frac 1  n      chopping the interval between   x   and   y   into three  top  and four  bottom  pieces   itâ  s a rational number  since products and sums of rational numbers are themselves rational numbers  since this works for any positive whole number   n    and there are infinitely many of those  i have just managed to find infinitely many rational numbers that lie between   x   and   y    the same kind of argument works for any two rational numbers   x   and   y    not just our two specific examples  therefore  whatever two rational numbers   x   and   y   you pick on the number line  i can always find

10x  9 8 2 x 2    we can see that the gradient of this curve  a parabola  changes over time  this represents how the velocity of our ball changes over time  it travels fastest  steepest positive gradient  sloping up from left to right  when it first leaves my hand  gradually slows down to almost a standstill at its highest point  a gradient of zero where it flattens out  and then speeds up as it falls back to earth  reaching its the steepest negative gradient just as i catch it again  sloping down from left to right   so we can plot how the velocity changes with time   graph of   y 10 9 8x

resource types contributor s guide         the bigger picture why are gradients important in mathematics     describe this graph   graph of   y x 2    you might say something like â  the   y   value goes to infinity as you go further to the left or right â   you might say â  it passes through the origin  the point    0 0    â   but i am almost certain that you will say something along the lines of â  it has a minimum value â   similarly if you saw this graph   graph of   y x x 1  x 1     i can be pretty sure that youâ  d comment that it has a small hill  called a local maximum  and a small ditch  called a local minimum   as well as heading off to positive and negative infinity  these maxima and minima are defining features of these graphs  a graph having a maximum or minimum  whether it dominates the whole graph as in the top example or just a local area  as in the second  tells you a great deal about the overall shape of the graph   not sure what details to put in here as not sure what parts of curve sketching they will have covered   alternatively  locating these turning points are key if you want to maximise  or minimise  the curveâ  s value  a maximum of a function can only occur if the gradient of the curve changes from positive to negative  creating a hilltop in the graph   the same goes for a minimum  where the gradient changes from negative to positive  creating a ditch in the graph   for any smooth graph  that is  it doesnâ  t have any gaps or spikes   this can only happen by the curve flattening out  and the point where the gradient is precisely zero is where the maximum occurs   not sure if we can mention the intermediate value theorem here   close up of top of   y  x 2   or local maximum in   y x 3   showing tangents with decreasing slope  and horizontal tangent at maximum   even if a point where the gradient is zero isnâ  t a maximum or a minimum  it is always a place where something interesting happens  for example in this graph  graph of   y x 3    as we move from left to right  the gradient flattens out from positive  to zero at the origin  and then becomes positive again  getting progressively steeper  the flat point in the curve in this example is called a point of inflection  the other thing a gradient might tell you is where something strange might occur  for example  consider the graph of tangent function   graph of tangent function  there are points of inflection where the graph has a gradient of zero  at   x 0   pi    pi  2 pi   2 pi  dots   etc  but really  that is not where the excitement is  look at what happens as the graph approaches   x  pi 2   from the left  the gradient gets steeper and steeper  closer and closer to vertically heading up to positive infinity  while as it approaches   x  pi 2   from the right  it gets steeper and steeper  closer to vertically heading down to negative infinity  this is because the line   x  pi 2   is a vertical asymptote for the tangent function  _ the function is defined arbitrarily close to this line but is not defined for   x   exactly equal to    pi 2    this is repeated all along the   x   axis  with asymptotes for   x    pi 2    pi 2  3 pi 2   3 pi 2  5 pi 2   5 pi 2   dots   and so on  you might get a horizontal asymptote  such as for the graph   y e   x     where the gradient of the graph flattens out but never quite become zero as   x   heads off to infinity   graph of   y e   x     or you might have an asymptote with some other gradient  in this example the gradient of the graph approaches either    1   or    1    running ever closer to the asymptotes   y x   and   y  x     graph of   x 2   y 2   1    with asymptotes   y x   and   y  x    the gradient of a graph is key to understanding the behaviour of the graph  and so the mathematical function it represents  and these concepts extend far beyond the shapes of one dimensional curves  we use the gradients to understand the shape of surfaces of any dimensions  to understand the curvature of mathematical spaces and to predict the behaviour of complex mathematical functions       printables  pdf version  relevance  c1 what is calculus about  and what is it useful for      last

equation of a circle so to begin i could try to rearrange the equation to look like that  but i think that the question really wants me to go back to first principles and show directly that these points lie on a circle  i know that a circle is the set of points lying an equal distance from the centre  maybe i can use that   for the second part  i need to show that the circles are entirely outside each other  perhaps looking at the ranges of   x   and   y   coordinates for each circle might help me    i tried thinking about the shortest distance between two non overlapping circles  and

first part of this problem in two ways  the first involves thinking about the algebraic equation of a circle  method 1 the general equation of a circle with radius   r   and centre    a b    is    x a  2    y b  2   r 2    substituting    x y     2 0        x y     8 0    and    x y     10 4    into this equation for a circle  we get three simultaneous equations in   a      b   and   r       2 a  2   b 2   r 2   and    8 a  2   b 2   r 2   and    10 a  2    4 b  2   r 2    taking the first equation away from the second  and expanding  we find the value of a     8 a  2    2 a  2   0  iff 64   16a   a 2   4   4a   a 2  iff 60   12a  iff a   5    substituting   a 5   into the second and third equations  we get   9   b 2   r 2   and   25    4 b  2   r 2    taking the first equation away from the second  and expanding  we find the value of   b      25    4 b  2   9   b 2   0  iff 25   16   8b   b 2   9   b 2   0  iff 32   8b  iff b   4    now  substituting   b 4   into the equation   25    4 b  2   r 2   from above  we get    25   r 2    this is true if  and only if    r   5    we know that   r   must be 5 rather than    5   as the radius of a circle must be positive  so the equation of this circle is    x 5  2    y 4  2   25    method 2 the second way of looking at this problem involves thinking about the circle geometrically  given any three points  we can think of a triangle with these points as its vertices  it is a fact that there is a unique circle passing through these three points  whose centre is the circumcentre of the triangle we just describedâ  that is  the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the three sides  our three points are   a  2 0       b  8 0     and   c  10 4     the line segment between    2 0    and    8 0    is part of the   x   axis  with midpoint    left  frac 2 8  2   frac 0 0  2  right   5 0     so the perpendicular bisector of the side   ab   is the line   x 5    the line segment between    8 0    and    10 4    has gradient    frac 4  2  2   and midpoint    left  frac 8 10  2   frac 0 4  2  right   9 2     so the perpendicular bisector of side   bc   is the line with gradient    frac  1  2    and passing through the point    9 2     substituting this information into the general equation for a line   y mx c    we find that the perpendicular bisector of side bc is the line   y  frac  1  2 x  frac 13  2      we could also calculate the perpendicular bisector of side   ca    which turns out to be the line   y  2x 14    but we donâ  t need to do this  because we are using the standard fact that the three perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle meet at a single point  you could check that this is true in this specific case if you wanted  substituting   x 5   into   y  frac  1  2 x    frac 13  2     we get the equation   y   frac 5  2   frac 13  2    which is true if and only if   y 4    so these two perpendicular bisectors intersect at the point    5 4     making this the centre of the circle  now  it is easy to find the radius of the circleâ  simply find the distance between the centre and one of the points given  the distance between   a  2 0    and    5 4    is    sqrt  2 5  2  0 4  2   sqrt 25  5    so the circle passing through these three points has centre    5 4    and radius   5    this means that it has equation    x 5  2    y 4  2   25     on the   y   axis  we know that   x 0    substituting   x 0   into the equation for this circle  we get    25    y 4  2   25  iff  y 4  2   0    this equation has only one solution    y 4    so the circle touches the   y   axis  setting   x 0   in the equation for the circle gives an equation in   y    if   y d   is a solution to this equation  then the circle intersects the   y   axis at    0 d     if this equation only has one solution  then the circle meets the   y   axis at only one point  and therefore the   y   axis must be a tangent to the circle   any line passing through the origin that is not the   y   axis must have equation   y mx   for some real number   m    we want to find an   m   such that   y mx   and    x 5  2  y 4  2 25   intersect at exactly one pointâ  then   y mx   will be a tangent to the circle passing through the origin  substituting   y mx   into    x 5  2  y 4  2 25   and expanding  we get a quadratic equation in   x   with coefficients in   m       x 5  2    mx 4  2   25      iff x 2   10x   25   m 2x 2   8mx   16   25      iff  m 2  1 x 2     10   8m x 16   0    for   y mx   to be a tangent to the circle  we must have only one root to this quadratic equationâ  that is  its discriminant must be zero  the discriminant of a quadratic equation   ax 2 bx c   0   is   b 2 4ac    the discriminant equals zero if  and only if  the equation has a repeated root  now     10 8m  2

value of   x   which satisfies this quadratic and hence the simultaneous equations  since   y   mx   c   is a linear equation in   x    this corresponds to exactly one value of   y    therefore the

now we have simultaneous equations for   m   and   c   which we can solve  substituting for   c   gives    11 2m  2   25 1 m 2     which rearranges to give   21m 2   44m   96   0       iff  3m 4   7m

on the circle    x 9  2  y 3  2 25    and therefore    a 9  2  b 3  2 25    we also know that   c   just touches the circle    x 2  2  y 4  2 100    so the centre of   c       a b     must lie a

diagram to get a feeling for the problem is always a good start  it looks as if i can get a rough idea as to where the two circles will lie  but i want to get the equations of the two circles  so i might want to start from the general equation of a circle  there are three conditions which my circles need to satisfy and all of these conditions should give me relations between the coordinates of the centre of the circle and its radius  perhaps iâ  ll end up with some equations that i can solve    if i want to prove that a given line is a common tangent to two circles  i think that i could just check this line is tangent to the first circle  and then that itâ  s also tangent to the second circle  i know a couple of useful facts about tangents to circles  one is that a tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point where they meet  and another is that the tangent and the circle intersect at exactly one point  perhaps that might help  ucles a level maths  qp 417 2 and 447 2  june 1966  q2  reproduced by permission of cambridge assessment group archives     the general equation of a circle with centre    a b    and radius   r   is    x   a  2    y   b  2   r 2    since the centre lies on the line   2y   x    we have that   2b   a    since the point    14 2    lies on the circle  we can substitute this and   2b   a   into our general equation to get    14   2b  2    2   b  2   r 2   quad   ast    we also know that the   x   axis just touches the circle  so we find their intersection by substituting   y   0   into our equation     x   a  2   b 2   r 2      iff x 2   2ax    a 2   b 2   r 2    0    this is a quadratic in   x    and it has exactly one solution since we know that the   x   axis is a tangent to the circle  so the discriminant   b 2   4ac   is equal to zero    4a 2   4 a 2   b 2   r 2    0      iff b 2   r 2    there is also a neat way of reaching    b  r   geometrically  the centre is    a b     and the   x   axis is a tangent  so it will touch the circle directly below  or above  the centre  at    a 0     because any tangent of a circle is perpendicular to a radius of that circle   then the distance from this point to the centre is    b     but this is also the radial distance  so    b    r    now we can substitute this into     ast    and solve for   b       14   2b  2    2   b  2   b 2      iff 196   56b   4b 2   4   4b   b

solutions are   b   5   quad a   10   quad r   5   and   b   10   quad a   20   quad r   10   and so the equations of the two circles are    x   10  2    y   5  2   25   and    x   20  2    y   10  2   100    for the second part of the question  we give two methods  the first uses direct substitution to find where the line intersects the two circles  the second uses the fact that the tangent to the circle will be perpendicular to the radius at that point  and avoids having to deal with quadratics  method 1 for the first circle  expanding and substituting   x    frac 3  4 y   we have   x 2   20x   y 2   10y   100   0  and  x    frac 3  4 y      rightarrow  frac 9  16 y 2   15y   y 2   10y   100   0      rightarrow  frac 25  16 y 2   25y   100   0      rightarrow y 2   16y   64   0      rightarrow  y   8  2   0      rightarrow y   8    now we can use   x    frac 3  4 y   to find that   x   6    this has a single solution  as expected  and so the line is a tangent to the circle  similarly for the second circle    x 2   40x   y 2   20y   400   0  and  x    frac 3  4 y      rightarrow  frac 9  16 y 2   30y   y 2   20y   400   0      rightarrow  frac 25  16 y 2   50y   400   0      rightarrow y 2   32y   196   0      rightarrow  y   16  2   0      rightarrow y   16    again we can use   x    frac 3  4 y   to find the corresponding value of   x    this time   x   12    so the line is also a tangent to this circle  and hence it is a common tangent to both of them  method 2 the tangent line is   3y   4x    that is   y    frac 4  3 x    the radius that passes through the intersection point will be perpendicular to this  so will have gradient    frac  3  4     so the general equation of the line will be   y    frac  3  4 x   c    the centre of the first circle lies on the line  so substituting    10 5    into the general equation gives   5    frac  3  4   times 10   c      rightarrow c    frac 25  2     so the radial line has equation   y    frac  3  4 x    frac 25

rightarrow  9x   150   16x      rightarrow 25x   150      rightarrow x   6   quad y   8    this is indeed a point on the circle     6   10  2    8   5  2   4 2   3 2   25    hence the line   3y   4x   intersects the radial line at a point on the circle  and so is a tangent line  using the same method for the second circle  we find that the intersection point is    12 16    and so the line is also a

types contributor s guide         the bigger picture general tragedy    whatâ  s the general solution to an equation  to answer this question you first need to find a general form for the equation  for a linear equation itâ  s   ax b 0   and for a quadratic itâ  s   ax 2 bx c 0    where   a      b   and  for the quadratic    c   are real numbers  the formulae for the general solutions are well known  they are   x   frac b  a    for the linear equation and   x    frac  b  pm  sqrt b 2 4ac   2a    for the quadratic equation  they work whatever the values of   a      b   and   c    though in the case of the quadratic the resulting solutions may involve the square root of a negative number  that is  a complex number   versions of both formulae were known to the babylonians nearly 4000 years ago  a natural question is whether there are similar general formulae for polynomial equations of higher degree  for example a cubic equation   a x 3   b x  2    cx   d    or a quartic equation   a x 4   b x  3    cx 2   dx   e    or a quintic equation   a x 5   b x  4    cx 3   dx 2   ex   f    itâ  s not an easy question  it took mathematicians until the 16th century to show that the answer is â  yesâ   for the cubic and the quartic equation and to provide those general formulae  which are too complicated to write down here   after that considerable achievement the hunt was on for the general solution of the quintic  but by 1800 it still hadnâ  t been found  in 1824 the norwegian mathematician niels henrik abel explained why  he proved that there isnâ  t one  this doesnâ  t mean that a quintic equation has no solutions  in fact  the fundamental theorem of algebra says that every polynomial equation in one variable has solutions  which may be complex numbers   neither does it mean that there never is a general formula  if the equation is particularly nice  for example    ax 5 b 0    then there may be one  in this case   x  sqrt 5   b a     what abel proved is that there isnâ  t a general formula which works for the most generic form of the equation when none of the coefficients are specified  abelâ  s result applies not just to the quintic  but to all polynomial equations in which the greatest power of   x    the degree of the equation  is greater than   4    when you are faced with such an equation you either have to hope that it has a particularly nice form for which there is a formula  or use one of several techniques for finding or approximating solutions  a few years after abel delivered his result  the young mathematical prodigy evariste galois  from france  decided to find out exactly why the general quintic equation should be unsolvable  he discovered that  in a particular mathematical sense  the solutions of an equation could be swapped around  just like the corners of a square are swapped around by applying one of its symmetries  for example rotating it by   90   degrees or reflecting it in an axis  galois developed a theory of symmetry for equations  which explained why there is not a general solution for a quintic  in the general case the symmetries just donâ  t behave in the right way  in doing so galois laid the foundations for what is now known as group theory  neither abel nor galois proved their results too soon  abel died in 1829  at the tender age of 27  from tuberculosis and in abject poverty  mathematicians of the day had recognised his genius  but they had never given him a job  galois died in 1832  he had been challenged to a duel for reasons that are not entirely clear  but seem to be connected to a woman he was in love with  stephanie felice du motel  in the night before the fateful morning galois jotted down his mathematical discoveries in a letter to a friend  the next morning he met his adversary and died

guide         the bigger picture maths for dinner    we often think of functions in terms of numbers and algebraic expressions  such as   f x    2x    and the graphs we can draw of them  but really the concept of a function is much more universal  and it can be easier to understand some of a functionâ  s basic features using a simpler example  imagine you have brought back some presents from holiday for your friends  to make sure everyone gets what they like  you make a list of the various presents  a list of your friendsâ   names  and draw an arrow from a present to a friend if you think that would be a good match  this allocation of chocolates to people is an example of a function  the domain of the function consists of the presents and the range consists of your friends  but you soon discover that not any old function will do  you definitely wouldnâ  t want to leave anyone out  each friend should receive at least one present  what you are looking for is a function that is surjective  or onto   for every element of the range  every friend  there should be at least one element of the domain  one present  that gets allocated to them  you also decide that no one should get more than one present  as that would be a bit much  so you also need your function to be injective  or one to one   for every element of the range  every friend  there should be no more than one element of the domain  one present  that gets allocated to it   the function on the left is injective but not surjective  the function on the right is surjective but not injective   what youâ  re looking for  then  is a function that is both injective  one to one  and surjective  onto â  and there is a name for that too  a function that is both injective and surjective is called a bijection  it gives you an exact correspondence between elements of the domain and the range  exactly one present for each person   this function is a bijection  given a finite list of presents  a domain  and friends  a range   can you always find a bijection between the two  the answer is no  if there is to be exactly one present for each friend  there have to be as many presents as friends  the domain has to contain the same number of elements as the range  conversely  if you are given two finite collections of things  people and presents   then knowing that there is a bijection between the two  exactly one present per friend  tells you immediately that the two collections have the same size  there are as many presents as friends   what are you getting at in this paragraph  the word â  converselyâ   is confusing me  because it refers to the second half of the paragraph which seems to say the same as the first  â  vicky one thing that is important to notice is that whether a function is injective  surjective or bijective depends on how you define the domain and range  imagine that after having carefully constructed a bijection between your presents and your friends  you suddenly notice that you have forgotten someone  adding this someone to your list of friends  exchanging the range  immediately ruins your bijection  as there isnâ  t a present for that new friend  the function you are left with is still injective  but not surjective  similarly  if instead of finding an extra friend you find an extra present in your bag and allocate it to someone  you extend the domain   then your function is no longer injective  as someone will now get two presents  therefore  when we are checking whether a function is injective  surjective or both  we need to be very clear about its domain and range  that goes not only for friends and presents  but also for more mathematical examples  such as the function   f x  2x    suppose we define the domain and the range to consist of all the natural numbers   1      2      3    â    to show that the function is injective  we need to show that no two distinct natural numbers   x_1   and   x_2   in the domain are allocated to the same number   y   of the range  this is clearly the case  since if   x_1   and   x_2   are distinct  then so are   2x_1   and   2x_2    to show that the function is surjective  we need to show that for every real number   y   in the range  there is a real number   x   in the domain that is allocated to it  this number would clearly have to be   y 2    but if   y   is odd  then   y 2   is not a natural number  so there isnâ  t an element of the domain that is allocated to it  therefore  the function is not surjective  we can remedy this situation by changing the range to consist only of the even natural numbers  in this case  the function is a bijection       printables  pdf version  relevance  f1 what are functions  and why are they useful    look forwards  the

that there is a range of negative values of   k   for which the equation has only one real root   the precise range of values of   k   is not required     firstly  we want to find the equations of the asymptotes  we can factorise the denominator of   y    frac 5x  x 2   1    to get   y    frac 5x   x 1  x 1      we can then see from this equation that    as   x  to 1        y  longrightarrow

asymptotes with equations   x   1   and   x    1    similarly  we can see from the equation that    as   x  to   infty      y  to 0        as   x  to   infty      y  to 0        so we also have a

which the graph crosses the axes is    0 0     therefore the graph will have the following shape   figure 1  now to find the number of real roots of the equation   kx   1    frac 5x  x 2   1    we

is a range of negative values of   k   for which the equation has only one real root  for the equation   kx   1    frac 5x  x 2   1    to have only one real root  there must be only one point of intersection between   y    frac 5x  x 2   1    and the line   y   kx   1    from the graph  we can see that the line   y   kx   1    for any   k  lt  0    must always intersect   y    frac 5x  x 2

1  lt  x  lt  1    and must not intersect it in either of the regions   x  gt  1   or   x  lt   1    there is a range of negative values of   k   for which this is true  as demonstrated below   figure

favourite song  the plane that took you on holiday  and the gps on your phone all have in common  they all involve waves or oscillations  the song is made from sound waves  the aircraftâ  s wings vibrate  and the gps function uses radio waves from gps satellites  there are many more waves around you  water waves  microwaves  the regular fluctuation of animal populations  lightâ  the list is almost endless  the most important tool for scientists and engineers to study those oscillations are the trigonometric sine and cosine functions  but how can that be  the graphs of the sine and cosine functions are fixed  how can they be used to describe all the different kind of waveforms that occur in the world around us  first of all  notice that we can change the shape of a sine  or cosine  wave by including constants in the algebraic expression that represents them  multiplying    sin x    by a constant   k   changes the height  amplitude  of the curve  for example  the red curve is   f x    0 5  sin x     the black one is   f x     sin x     and the blue one is   f x    2  sin x      multiplying the variable   x   by a constant   k   changes the distance between the peaks of the wave  the wavelength   for example  the red curve is   f x     sin 0 5 x     the black one is   f x     sin x     and the blue one is   f x     sin 2x      and by adding a constant   k   to the variable   x   before applying the sine function  we can shift it along the   x   axis  change its phase   for example  the red curve is   f x     sin x   0 5     the black one is   f x     sin x     and the blue one is   f x     sin x   0 5      using a combination of all three gives us quite a lot of room for variation  but still  this doesnâ  t seem to be enough enough  when we record a note played on a violin and look at a graphical representation of that sound  we see that it looks much more jagged than a pure sine or cosine wave   maybe we can add an image here  â  vicky  thatâ  s because the violin doesnâ  t play a pure note  but also a range of other sounds called harmonics  similarly  the vibrations of an aircraft wing or a car component arenâ  t always smooth and regular  and radio signals from satellites are often corrupted and scrambled up by random interferences  but rather amazingly  we can still capture those more complicated waveforms using our familiar trig functions  at the beginning of the 19th century the french mathematician joseph fourier showed that any reasonably nice periodic function  there are precise conditions for what â  reasonably niceâ   means  can be written as a  possibly infinite  sum of sine and cosine functions  for example  the graph below shows the graph of   f x     sin 5x  0 5 cos 10x        f x     sin 5x    0 5 cos 10x     even the decidedly un smooth square wave can be expressed as a sum of nicely undulating sine and cosine waves  only this time the sum is infinite  the green curve in the animation is what we get by adding more and more sine and cosine terms  as we add more terms  it converges to the square wave  in red   individual terms in the infinite sum are of the form    frac 1  k  left  sin  fkx   right

function   f   isnâ  t periodic  we still can represent it by a sum of sine and cosine functions  at least on a finite interval  we can write the interval from   a   to   b    including   a   but excluding   b    as    a b     now take the graph of our function as defined on    a b    and glue copies of that graph next to each other  one after the other  in both directions  the result is a

building periodic functions from sine and cosine is fun  but whatâ  s even more amazing is that you can go the other way  there is a technique called fourier analysis that helps us to break down a function  whether itâ  s periodic or defined on an interval  into its constituent components  itâ  s incredibly useful  we can use it in all aspects of sound processing  to analyse light from distant stars  make aircraft safe by keeping vibrations under control  decode radio signals from gps satellites  process images  understand the motion of earthquakes  and to reconstruct the inside of a

the way through  for all   x    with their beautifully undulating shapes they also give us the most perfect mathematical description of waves   we probably need some pictures here  â  vicky  when we first learn about sine and cosine though  itâ  s in the context of right angled triangles  how do the two faces of these two functions fit together  to answer this question  letâ  s go back by 2000 years or so  to a time when early astronomers were trying to chart the night sky  when you look up at this star studded expanse  itâ  s easy to imagine that all the heavenly objects lie on a celestial sphere that curves around us  with the earth at its centre  for those early astronomers  doing astronomy meant doing geometry involving spheresâ  and in order to do that you need to be able to do geometry involving circles  one natural question to ask about a circle is this  given two points   a   and   b   on it  such as two stars on a 2d celestial sphere   what is the distance between them  measured along the straight line that lies inside the circle  such a straight line is called a chord of the circle  its length clearly depends on the angle    alpha   formed by the two straight line segments that connect   a   and   b   to the centre of the circle  the smaller    alpha    the smaller the length of the chord  to help them with their calculations astronomers produced tables of chords  giving the chord lengths that correspond to given angles  the first person to have written down such a table of chords seems to have been the greek astronomer hipparchus of nicaea  ca 180bc   ca 125bc    are people going to be anxious that it also depends on the radius of the circle  â  vicky   figure 1   letâ  s make our own version  â  vicky  image stolen and adapted from here  http

producing tables that related chord lengths to angles    alpha    they produced tables that related half chord lengths to half angles    alpha 2    splitting the angle    alpha   in two gives a right angled triangle   t    with corners the centre   o   of the circle  the point   a   and the mid point   m   of the original chord  the side opposite   o   is half the original chord  and the hypotenuse of   t   is just the radius   r   of the circle   figure 2   letâ  s make our own version  â  vicky  image stolen and adapted from here  http   www clarku edu  djoyce ma105 trighist html  need to redraw now the length of the half chord depends not only on    alpha 2   but also on the radius   r   of the circle  in modern notation  the length is    sin  alpha 2   times r    so when indian mathematicians produced tables relating half angles to half chords  they were essentially producing sine tables  itâ  s from them that we get our definition of sine  and also cosine  the

        the bigger picture going backwards    there are situations in life in which itâ  s useful to go backwards  imagine  for example  youâ  re a bank  your computer contains a list of names  your clients  and for each name there is a number  the clientâ  s account balance   that number is positive if the client is in credit and negative if they are in debt  now imagine that  unfortunately  your system has been attacked by a virus that has systematically changed the account balances of all your customers  your it expert can figure out what formula the virus used to change the numbers  but thatâ  s all you know  can you figure out the original numbers from the list of changed ones  it depends  say your it experts tells you that the virus has added â 1000000 to each account balance  in this case itâ  s easy to work out what the original numbers were  you simply subtract â 1000000 from each number in the new list  but what if the virus has squared every account balance  then you have a problem  if  for example  the changed balance of client a is â 100  then their original balance could have been â 10 or  â 10  as each number gives you â 100 when squared  you have no way of figuring out the original numbers without further information  what you have been trying to do here is find the inverse of a function  in the first example  with the virus adding â 1000000  the function is   f x    x   1000000   and in the second  with the virus squaring  it is   f x    x 2    the inverse of   f   is the function   g   that goes the other way  given an   f x     the function   g   should return the original   x    that is    g f x   x    to find out whether a function has an inverse we need to know its domain and range  in our example the domain contains the original account balances  which we donâ  t know  but since these can be negative or positive numbers  letâ  s take the domain to consist of all the real numbers  and letâ  s take the range to consist of the list of altered account balances  a function   f   has an inverse if  and only if  for every element of its range  every   y   in the range  there is exactly one element of the domain  one   x   in the domain  so that   f x    y    the function in the first example    f x    x   1000000    clearly satisfies the requirement that for every element   y   in the range there is exactly one element   x   in the domain so that   f x  y    that element is   y 1000000    the function therefore has an inverse  itâ  s   g x    x   1000000    the function in the second example    f x    x 2    does not satisfy this property  for every positive number   y   in the range there are two numbers that are allocated to it by the function  these numbers are    sqrt y    and     sqrt y     since   f  sqrt y  2    f    sqrt y   2    y    this is the reason why you cannot figure out the original account balances    f   does not have an inverse  a little more information about the domain  however  might help  suppose you know that none of the customers were in debt  this restricts your domain to the positive real numbers and zero  for every number   y   in the range there now is exactly one number   x   in the domain such that   f x    y    that number is    sqrt y     so your inverse function is   g x     sqrt x     since   g f x      sqrt x 2    x    the general rule is this  to find out whether a function has an inverse  look at its domain and its range  and then figure out whether for every element   y   in the range there is exactly one element   x   in the domain so that   f x  y    if there is  then you can go backwards       printables  pdf version  relevance  f3 how can we build new functions from old      last updated 07 feb 2014

        the bigger picture catching waves    what do your favourite song  the plane that took you on holiday  and the gps on your phone all have in common  they all involve waves or oscillations  the song is made from sound waves  the aircraftâ  s wings vibrate  and the gps function uses radio waves from gps satellites  there are many more waves around you  water waves  microwaves  the regular fluctuation of animal populations  lightâ  the list is almost endless  the most important tool for scientists and engineers to study those oscillations are the trigonometric sine and cosine functions  but how can that be  the graphs of the sine and cosine functions are fixed  how can they be used to describe all the different kind of waveforms that occur in the world around us  first of all  notice that we can change the shape of a sine  or cosine  wave by including constants in the algebraic expression that represents them  multiplying    sin x    by a constant   k   changes the height  amplitude  of the curve  for example  the red curve is   f x    0 5  sin x     the black one is   f x     sin x     and the blue one is   f x    2  sin x      multiplying the variable   x   by a constant   k   changes the distance between the peaks of the wave  the wavelength   for example  the red curve is   f x     sin 0 5 x     the black one is   f x     sin x     and the blue one is   f x     sin 2x      and by adding a constant   k   to the variable   x   before applying the sine function  we can shift it along the   x   axis  change its phase   for example  the red curve is   f x     sin x   0 5     the black one is   f x     sin x     and the blue one is   f x     sin x   0 5      using a combination of all three gives us quite a lot of room for variation  but still  this doesnâ  t seem to be enough enough  when we record a note played on a recorder and look at a graphical representation of that sound  we see that it looks much more jagged than a pure sine or cosine wave  here you can listen to the note and see its graph  you could also play the sound into software such as the free audacity to generate the graphical representation yourself    the graphical representation of the recorder note  thatâ  s because the recorder doesnâ  t play a pure note  but also a range of other sounds called harmonics  similarly  the vibrations of an aircraft wing or a car component arenâ  t always smooth and regular  and radio signals from satellites are often corrupted and scrambled up by random interferences  but rather amazingly  we can still capture those more complicated waveforms using our familiar trig functions  at the beginning of the 19th century the french mathematician joseph fourier showed that any reasonably nice periodic function  there are precise conditions for what â  reasonably niceâ   means  can be written as a  possibly infinite  sum of sine and cosine functions  for example  the graph below shows the graph of   f x     sin 5x  0 5 cos 10x        f x     sin 5x    0 5 cos 10x     even the decidedly un smooth square wave can be expressed as a sum of nicely undulating sine and cosine waves  only this time the sum is infinite  the green curve in the animation is what we get by adding more and more sine and cosine terms  as we add more terms  it converges to the square wave  in red   individual terms in the infinite sum are of the form    frac 1

 b    including   a   but excluding   b    as    a b     now take the graph of our function as defined on    a b    and glue copies of that graph next to each other  one after the other  in both

analysis that helps us to break down a function  whether itâ  s periodic or defined on an interval  into its constituent components  itâ  s incredibly useful  we can use it in all aspects of sound

look up at this star studded expanse  itâ  s easy to imagine that all the heavenly objects lie on a celestial sphere that curves around us  with the earth at its centre  for those early astronomers  doing astronomy meant doing geometry involving spheresâ  and in order to do that you need to be able to do geometry involving circles  one natural question to ask about a circle is this  given two points   a   and   b   on it  such as two stars on a 2d celestial sphere   what is the distance between them  measured along the straight line that lies inside the circle  such a straight line is called a chord of the circle  its length clearly depends on the angle    alpha   formed by the two straight line segments that connect   a   and   b   to the centre of the circle  the smaller    alpha    the smaller the length of the chord  this is true no matter how small or big your circle is  to help them with their calculations astronomers produced tables of chords  giving the chord lengths that correspond to given angles  the first person to have written down such a table of chords seems to have been the greek astronomer hipparchus of nicaea  ca 180bc   ca 125bc    figure 1   letâ  s

geometry as practical measurement and as rules for dividing and combining shapes of different kinds for building temples  palaces and for civil engineering  for their everyday practical purposes  people lived on a â  flatâ   earth  a â  straight lineâ   was a tightly stretched rope  and a circle could be drawn by tracing round a fixed point     aristotle  384 322  bce    much of the knowledge of these peoples was well known around the mediterranean  and when the greek civilisation began to assert itself in the 4th century bce  philosophers like aristotle  384 322 bce   developed a particular way of thinking  and promoted a mode of discussion which required the participants to state as clearly as possible the basis of their argument  in this atmosphere  greek logic was born       euclid of alexandria  325 265  bce    during this period  alexandria became one of the important centres of greek learning and this is where euclidâ  s elements of mathematics was written in about 300 bce  following aristotleâ  s principles  euclid based his mathematics on a series of definitions of basic objects like points  straight lines  surfaces  angles  circles and triangles  and axioms  or postulates   these were the agreed starting points for his development of mathematics    the first three postulates are about what can be done  the next one about equality of right angles and the final statement uses the sum of two right angles to define whether two lines meet   draw a straight line from any point to any other point  produce  extend  a finite straight line continuously in a straight line  describe a circle with any centre and distance  all right angles are equal to each other  if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles  then if the two lines are produced indefinitely  they will meet on that side where the angles are less than the two right angles        the fifth postulate almost as soon as euclid put his pen down  mathematicians and philosophers were having difficulty with the fifth postulate  in contrast to the short statements of the first four  the fifth looked as though it ought to be a theorem  not an axiom  meaning that it ought to be deducible from the other axioms  we know this from various logical analyses written by other mathematicians  in the fifth century ce  proclus  411 485 ce  gave a simpler version of the fifth postulate       playfairs axiom     given a line and a point not on the line  it is possible to draw exactly one line through the given point parallel

converse of proposition 21 in euclid book vi b â  figures which are similar to the same rectilinear figure are also similar to one anotherâ    euclid uses this proposition to establish that similarity

artists improved on these methods  and in 1525 albrecht durer  1471 1528  produced a book demonstrating a number of mechanical aids for perspective drawing  perspective picture by durer durer â  reclining womanâ   perspective picture durer albrecht durer  1471 1528  desargues and projective geometry in 1639  girard desargues  1591 1661  wrote his ground breaking treatise on projective geometry  he had earlier produced a manual of practical perspective for architects and another on stone cutting for masons  but his approach was theoretical and difficult to understand  in his 1639 treatise he introduced many new fundamental concepts  the term â  point at infinityâ    the vanishing point  appears for the first time  he also uses the ideas of a â  cone of visionâ   and talks about â  pencils of linesâ    like the lines emanating from the vanishing point   and if you can have a point at infinity  why not more  to make lines at infinity    this was a completely new kind of geometry  the fundamental relationships were based on ideas of â  projection and sectionâ   which means that any rigid euclidean shape can be transformed into another â  similarâ   shape by a perspective transformation   a square can be transformed into a parallelogram  think of shadow play  and while the number and order of the sides remain the same  their length varies  durer cone section durerâ  s cone picture the new geometry was not recognized at the time  because desarguesâ   technical language was difficult  and also because renã  descartesâ   coordinate geometry published three years earlier was so popular  in the late 18th century desarguesâ   work was rediscovered  and developed both theoretically and practically into a coherent system  with central concepts of invariance and duality   in projective geometry lengths  and ratios of lengths  angles and the shapes of figures  can all change under projection  parallel lines do not exist because any pair of distinct lines intersect in a point  properties that are invariant under projection are the order of three or more points on a line and the cross ratio  among four points  a b c d  so that acbc adbd another important concept in projective geometry is duality   in the plane  the terms â  pointâ   and â  lineâ   are dual and can be interchanged in any valid statement to yield another valid statement  see leoâ  s articles on proof  for the invariants and projection and section  and on the four colour theorem  for duality    modern geometries in spite of the practical inventions of spherical trigonometry by arab astronomers  of perspective geometry by renaissance painters  and projective geometry by desargues and later 18th century mathematicians  euclidean geometry was still held to be the true geometry of the real world  nevertheless  mathematicians still worried about the validity of the parallel postulate   in 1663 the english mathematician john wallis had translated the work of al tusi and followed his line of reasoning  to prove the fifth postulate he assumed that for every figure there is a similar one of arbitrary size  however  wallis realized that his proof was based on an assumption equivalent to the parallel postulate  saccheri title page saccheriâ  s title page girolamo saccheri  1667 1733  entered the jesuit order in 1685  he went to milan  studied philosophy and theology and mathematics  he became a priest and taught at various jesuit colleges  finally teaching philosophy and theology at pavia  and holding the chair of mathematics there until his death  saccheri knew about the work of the arab mathematicians and followed the reasoning of al tusi in his investigation of the parallel postulate  and in 1733 he published his famous book  euclid freed from every flaw  in his first proposition at the beginning of his book  saccheri constructed a quadrilateral in a similar manner to that of omar khayyam  above  and proved that the angles adb and bca are equal  he then considered the length of the upper side of the quadrilateral cd  and in proposition iii set up the three possibilities  depending on whether cd is equal to  or less  or greater than the base ab  these possibilities are equivalent to  hypothesis i   there is exactly one parallel  the right angle case  cd ab  hypothesis ii  there are no parallels  the obtuse angle case  cd lt  ab  hypothesis iii   there are more than one parallel  the acute angle case  cd gt  ab  saccheri hypothesis diagram saccheri hypotheses diagram saccheri assumes that  i  a straight line divides the plane into two separate regions and  ii  that straight line can be infinite in extent  these assumptions are incompatible with the obtuse angle case  and so this is rejected  however  they are compatible with the acute angle case  and we can see from his diagram  fig  33  and proposition xxxii below that he is treating the intersection at infinity as a finite point  and this is where his contradiction lies  saccheri fig 33 proposition xxxii â  now i say there is  in the hypothesis of acute angle  a certain determinate acute angle bax drawn under which ax  fig  33  only at an infinite distance meets bx  and thus is a limit in part from within  in part from without  on the one hand of all those which under lesser acute angles meet the aforesaid bx at a finite distance  on the other hand also of the others which under greater acute angles  even to a right angle inclusive  have a common perpendicular in two distinct points with bx â   to us now  the curved line ax looks like an asymptote  but he says that ax meets bx â  at an infinite distanceâ   so that in the next proposition xxxiii he states  â  the hypothesis of acute angle is absolutely false  because it is repugnant to the nature of the straight lineâ    the irony is that in the next twenty or so pages  in order to show that the acute angle case is impossible  he demonstrates a number of elegant theorems of non euclidean geometry  it was clear that saccheri could not cope with a perfectly logical conclusion that appeared to him to be against common sense  saccheriâ  s work was virtually unknown until 1899 when it was discovered and republished by the italian mathematician  eugenio beltrami  1835 1900   as far as we know it had no influence on lambert  legendre or gauss  lambert johan heinrich lambert  1728 1777  johan heinrich lambert  1728 1777  followed a similar plan to saccheri  he investigated the hypothesis of the acute angle without obtaining a contradiction  lambert noticed the curious fact that  in this new geometry  the angle sum of a triangle increased as the area of the triangle decreased  adrien marie legendre  1752 1833  spent many years working on the parallel postulate and his efforts appear in different editions of his ã lã ments de gã omã trie  legendre proved that the fifth postulate is equivalent to the statement that the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles   legendre also obtained a number of consistent but counter intuitive results in his investigations  but was unable to bring these ideas together into a consistent system  many of the consequences of the parallel postulate  taken with the other four axioms for plane geometry  can be shown logically to imply the parallel postulate  for example  these statements can also be regarded as equivalent to the parallel postulate  in any triangle  the three angles sum to two right angles  in any triangle  each exterior angle equals the sum of the two internally opposite angles  if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal  the alternate interior angles are equal  and the corresponding angles are equal  carl friedrich gauss  1777 1855  gauss carl friedrich gauss  1777 1855  gauss was the first person to truly understand the problem of parallels  he began work on the fifth postulate by attempting to prove it from the other four  but by 1817 he was convinced that the fifth postulate was independent of the other four  and then began to work on a geometry where more than one line can be drawn through a given point parallel to a given line  he told one or two close friends about his work  though he never published it and in a private letter of 1824 he wrote  â  the assumption that  in a triangle  the sum of the three angles is less than 180o leads to a curious geometry  quite different from ours  but thoroughly consistent  which i have developed to my entire satisfactionâ    the final breakthrough was made quite independently by two men  and it is clear that both bolyai and lobachevski were completely unaware of each otherâ  s work  lobachevski nikolai ivanovich lobachevski  1792 1856  nikolai ivanovich lobachevski  1792 1856  did not try to prove the fifth postulate but worked on a geometry where the fifth postulate does not necessarily hold  lobachevski thought of euclidean geometry as a special case of this more general geometry  and so was more open to strange and unusual possibilities  in 1829 he published the first account of his investigations in russian in a journal of the university of kazan but it was not noticed  his original work  geometriya had already been completed in 1823  but not published until 1909  lobachevski explained how his geometry works  â  all straight lines which in a plane go out from a point can  with reference to a given straight line in the same plane  be divided into two classes   into cutting and non cutting  the boundary lines of the one and the other class of those lines will be called parallel to the given line â   the red line is the boundary  the â  parallelâ   to the line bc  lobachevski diagram lobachevski tried to get his work geometrical investigations on the theory of parallels recognized  and an account in french in 1837 brought his work on non euclidean geometry to a wide audience but the mathematical community was not yet ready to accept these revolutionary ideas  lobachevski diagram jã nos bolyai  1802 1860  was the son of the mathematician farkas bolyai  a friend of gauss  farkas had worked on the problem of the fifth postulate  but had not been able to make any headway  bolyai jã nos bolyai  1802 1860    in 1823 young jã nos wrote to his father saying  â  i have discovered things so wonderful that i was astounded â   out of nothing i have created a strange new world â   however it took jã nos two more years before it was completed and his work was published as an appendix to his fatherâ  s text book  jã nos had shown that a consistent geometry using the acute angle hypothesis case was possible  jã nos bolyai set out to investigate the three basic hypotheses of the right  obtuse  and acute angles by separating the case where the fifth postulate was true  the right angle case  from the cases where it was not true  on this basis he set up two systems of geometry  and searched for theorems that could be valid in both  jã nos bolyaiâ  s work was read by gauss who recognized and gave credit to the young genius  however  when gauss later explained to jã nos that he himself had made these discoveries some years before  janos was devastated  later  jã nos learned that lobachevski had anticipated his work which disappointed him even more  he continued to work in mathematics  presenting some original ideas  but his enthusiasm and health deteriorated and he never published again  lobachevski and bolyai had discovered what we now call hyperbolic geometry  this is the geometry of the acute angle hypothesis where a â  lineâ   is no longer a straight line and there are many possible lines through a given point which do not intersect another line  this is very difficult to visualize  and for people brought up to believe euclidean geometry was â  trueâ   this was counter intuitive and unacceptable  beltrami eugenio beltrami  1835 1900  it was not until beltrami produced the first model for hyperbolic geometry on the surface of a pseudo sphere in 1868 that many mathematicians began to accept this strange new geometry  half pseudo sphere imagine a circular polar grid  like a dart board  pulled up from the origin  it forms a trumpet like surface  any triangle drawn on this grid will become even more distorted when an apex is near the origin  all the lines going up the surface are asymptotes to a single central line rising vertically from the origin  these lines are all â  parallelâ   lines passing through a single limit point at infinity  tractrix if the tractrix is rotated about its vertical axis  the surface formed will be a complete pseudo sphere  poincare disc model in the poincare model  all â  linesâ   are arcs of circles  except for the diameter  the arc of a circle with infinite radius   â  parallelâ   lines are thought of as asymptotes where the limit point is on the circumference  with this model many â  parallelsâ   can pass through the same point  this disc has a basic four fold symmetry  the yellow poincare disc has symmetry order seven  maurits escher used a six fold symmetry for his â  circle limit ivâ   engraving   the picture with the interlocking angels and devils  for more on escher see  http   www mcescher com  gradually other models helped to make the new ideas more secure and in 1872 the famous german mathematician felix klein  1849 1925  produced his general view of geometry by unifying the different spherical  perspective projective and hyperbolic geometries with others as sets of axioms and properties invariant under the action of certain transformations  in this way  mathematicians at last became free to think of geometry in the abstract as a set of axioms  operations and logical rules that were not tied to the physical world  for

bodies  they have been specially built as part of ancient observatories  and as they became larger had to be supported by solid walls to keep them steady  it was believed that the larger the instrument was  the more accurate were the results obtained  it is true that the larger the instrument is  the easier it is to divide the scale of the quadrant into degrees  minutes and seconds  however  the accuracy can also depend on other things like the sighting instrument  for example  telescopes were not developed well enough to be reliable until the early 18th century  and because the mounting was fixed  it had limited use  in spite of the problems  arab astronomers were able to achieve an accuracy of about 20 seconds of arc  wall quadrant weblinks these are the most reliable and

amount of geometry as practical measurement and as rules for dividing and combining shapes of different kinds for building temples  palaces and for civil engineering  for their everyday practical purposes  people lived on a â  flatâ   earth  a â  straight lineâ   was a tightly stretched rope  and a circle could be drawn by tracing round a fixed point     aristotle  384 322  bce    much of the knowledge of these peoples was well known around the mediterranean  and when the greek civilisation began to assert itself in the 4th century bce  philosophers like aristotle  384 322 bce   developed a particular way of thinking  and promoted a mode of discussion which required the participants to state as clearly as possible the basis of their argument  in this atmosphere  greek logic was born       euclid of alexandria  325 265  bce    during this period  alexandria became one of the important centres of greek learning and this is where euclidâ  s elements of mathematics was written in about 300 bce  following aristotleâ  s principles  euclid based his mathematics on a series of definitions of basic objects like points  straight lines  surfaces  angles  circles and triangles  and axioms  or postulates   these were the agreed starting points for his development of mathematics    the first three postulates are about what can be done  the next one about equality of right angles and the final statement uses the sum of two right angles to define whether two lines meet   draw a straight line from any point to any other point  produce  extend  a finite straight line continuously in a straight line  describe a circle with any centre and distance  all right angles are equal to each other  if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles  then if the two lines are produced indefinitely  they will meet on that side where the angles are less than the two right angles        the fifth postulate almost as soon as euclid put his pen down  mathematicians and philosophers were having difficulty with the fifth postulate  in contrast to the short statements of the first four  the fifth looked as though it ought to be a theorem  not an axiom  meaning that it ought to be deducible from the other axioms  we know this from various logical analyses written by other mathematicians  in the fifth century ce  proclus

geometry  he had earlier produced a manual of practical perspective for architects and another on stone cutting for masons  but his approach was theoretical and difficult to understand  in his 1639 treatise he introduced many new fundamental concepts  the term â  point at infinityâ    the vanishing point  appears for the first time  he also uses the ideas of a â  cone of visionâ   and talks about â  pencils of linesâ    like the lines emanating from the vanishing point   and if you can have a point at infinity  why not more  to make lines at infinity    this was a completely new kind of geometry  the fundamental relationships were based on ideas of â  projection and sectionâ   which means that any rigid euclidean shape can be transformed into another â  similarâ   shape by a perspective transformation   a square can be transformed into a parallelogram  think of shadow play  and while the number and order of the sides remain the same  their length varies  durer cone section durerâ  s cone picture the new geometry was not recognized at the time  because desarguesâ   technical language was difficult  and also because renã  descartesâ   coordinate geometry published three years earlier was so popular  in the late 18th century desarguesâ   work was rediscovered  and developed both theoretically and practically into a coherent system  with central concepts of invariance and duality   in projective geometry lengths  and ratios of lengths  angles and the shapes of figures  can all change under projection  parallel lines do not exist because any pair of distinct lines intersect in a point  properties that are invariant under projection are the order of three or more points on a line and the cross ratio  among four points  a b c d  so that acbc adbd another important concept in projective geometry is duality   in the plane  the terms â  pointâ   and â  lineâ   are dual and can be interchanged in any valid statement to yield another valid statement  see leoâ  s articles on proof  for the invariants and projection and section  and on the four colour theorem  for duality    modern geometries in spite of the practical inventions of spherical trigonometry by arab astronomers  of perspective geometry by renaissance painters  and projective geometry by desargues and later 18th century mathematicians  euclidean geometry was still held to be the true geometry of the real world  nevertheless  mathematicians still worried about the validity of the parallel postulate   in 1663 the english mathematician john wallis had translated the work of al tusi and followed his line of reasoning  to prove the fifth postulate he assumed that for every figure there is a similar one of arbitrary size  however  wallis realized that his proof was based on an assumption equivalent to the parallel postulate  saccheri title page saccheriâ  s title page girolamo saccheri  1667 1733  entered the jesuit order in 1685  he went to milan  studied philosophy and theology and mathematics  he became a priest and taught at various jesuit colleges  finally teaching philosophy and theology at pavia  and holding the chair of mathematics there until his death  saccheri knew about the work of the arab mathematicians and followed the reasoning of al tusi in his investigation of the parallel postulate  and in 1733 he published his famous book  euclid freed from every flaw  in his first proposition at the beginning of his book  saccheri constructed a quadrilateral in a similar manner to that of omar khayyam  above  and proved that the angles adb and bca are equal  he then considered the length of the upper side of the quadrilateral cd  and in proposition iii set up the three possibilities  depending on whether cd is equal to  or less  or greater than the base ab  these possibilities are equivalent to  hypothesis i   there is exactly one parallel  the right angle case  cd ab  hypothesis ii  there are no parallels  the obtuse angle case  cd lt  ab  hypothesis iii   there are more than one parallel  the acute angle case  cd gt  ab  saccheri hypothesis diagram saccheri hypotheses diagram saccheri assumes that  i  a straight line divides the plane into two separate regions and  ii  that straight line can be infinite in extent  these assumptions are incompatible with the obtuse angle case  and so this is rejected  however  they are compatible with the acute angle case  and we can see from his diagram  fig  33  and proposition xxxii below that he is treating the intersection at infinity as a finite point  and this is where his contradiction lies  saccheri fig 33 proposition xxxii â  now i say there is  in the hypothesis of acute angle  a certain determinate acute angle bax drawn under which ax  fig  33  only at an infinite distance meets bx  and thus is a limit in part from within  in part from without  on the one hand of all those which under lesser acute angles meet the aforesaid bx at a finite distance  on the other hand also of the others which under greater acute angles  even to a right angle inclusive  have a common perpendicular in two distinct points with bx â   to us now  the curved line ax looks like an asymptote  but he says that ax meets bx â  at an infinite distanceâ   so that in the next proposition xxxiii he states  â  the hypothesis of acute angle is absolutely false  because it is repugnant to the nature of the straight lineâ    the irony is that in the next twenty or so pages  in order to show that the acute angle case is impossible  he demonstrates a number of elegant theorems of non euclidean geometry  it was clear that saccheri could not cope with a perfectly logical conclusion that appeared to him to be against common sense  saccheriâ  s work was virtually unknown until 1899 when it was discovered and republished by the italian mathematician  eugenio beltrami  1835 1900   as far as we know it had no influence on lambert  legendre or gauss  lambert johan heinrich lambert  1728 1777  johan heinrich lambert  1728 1777  followed a similar plan to saccheri  he investigated the hypothesis of the acute angle without obtaining a contradiction  lambert noticed the curious fact that  in this new geometry  the angle sum of a triangle increased as the area of the triangle decreased  adrien marie legendre  1752 1833  spent many years working on the parallel postulate and his efforts appear in different editions of his ã lã ments de gã omã trie  legendre proved that the fifth postulate is equivalent to the statement that the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles   legendre also obtained a number of consistent but counter intuitive results in his investigations  but was unable to bring these ideas together into a consistent system  many of the consequences of the parallel postulate  taken with the other four axioms for plane geometry  can be shown logically to imply the parallel postulate  for example  these statements can also be regarded as equivalent to the parallel postulate  in any triangle  the three angles sum to two right angles  in any triangle  each exterior angle equals the sum of the two internally opposite angles  if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal  the alternate interior angles are equal  and the corresponding angles are equal  carl friedrich gauss  1777 1855  gauss carl friedrich gauss  1777 1855  gauss was the first person to truly understand the problem of parallels  he began work on the fifth postulate by attempting to prove it from the other four  but by 1817 he was convinced that the fifth postulate was independent of the other four  and then began to work on a geometry where more than one line can be drawn through a given point parallel to a given line  he told one or two close friends about his work  though he never published it and in a private letter of 1824 he wrote  â  the assumption that  in a triangle  the sum of the three angles is less than 180o leads to a curious geometry  quite different from ours  but thoroughly consistent  which i have developed to my entire satisfactionâ    the final breakthrough was made quite independently by two men  and it is clear that both bolyai and lobachevski were completely unaware of each otherâ  s work  lobachevski nikolai ivanovich lobachevski  1792 1856  nikolai ivanovich lobachevski  1792 1856  did not try to prove the fifth postulate but worked on a geometry where the fifth postulate does not necessarily hold  lobachevski thought of euclidean geometry as a special case of this more general geometry  and so was more open to strange and unusual possibilities  in 1829 he published the first account of his investigations in russian in a journal of the university of kazan but it was not noticed  his original work  geometriya had already been completed in 1823  but not published until 1909  lobachevski explained how his geometry works  â  all straight lines which in a plane go out from a point can  with reference to a given straight line in the same plane  be divided into two classes   into cutting and non cutting  the boundary lines of the one and the other class of those lines will be called parallel to the given line â   the red line is the boundary  the â  parallelâ   to the line bc  lobachevski diagram lobachevski tried to get his work geometrical investigations on the theory of parallels recognized  and an account in french in 1837 brought his work on non euclidean geometry to a wide audience but the mathematical community was not yet ready to accept these revolutionary ideas  lobachevski diagram jã nos bolyai  1802 1860  was the son of the mathematician farkas bolyai  a friend of gauss  farkas had worked on the problem of the fifth postulate  but had not been able to make any headway  bolyai jã nos bolyai  1802 1860    in 1823 young jã nos wrote to his father saying  â  i have discovered things so wonderful that i was astounded â   out of nothing i have created a strange new world â   however it took jã nos two more years before it was completed and his work was published as an appendix to his fatherâ  s text book  jã nos had shown that a consistent geometry using the acute angle hypothesis case was possible  jã nos bolyai set out to investigate the three basic hypotheses of the right  obtuse  and acute angles by separating the case where the fifth postulate was true  the right angle case  from the cases where it was not true  on this basis he set up two systems of geometry  and searched for theorems that could be valid in both  jã nos bolyaiâ  s work was read by gauss who recognized and gave credit to the young genius  however  when gauss later explained to jã nos that he himself had made these discoveries some years before  janos was devastated  later  jã nos learned that lobachevski had anticipated his work which disappointed him even more  he continued to work in mathematics  presenting some original ideas  but his enthusiasm and health deteriorated and he never published again  lobachevski and bolyai had discovered what we now call hyperbolic geometry  this is the geometry of the acute angle hypothesis where a â  lineâ   is no longer a straight line and there are many possible lines through a given point which do not intersect another line  this is very difficult to visualize  and for people brought up to believe euclidean geometry was â  trueâ   this was counter intuitive and unacceptable  beltrami eugenio beltrami  1835 1900  it was not until beltrami produced the first model for hyperbolic geometry on the surface of a pseudo sphere in 1868 that many mathematicians began to accept this strange new geometry  half pseudo sphere imagine a circular polar grid  like a dart board  pulled up from the origin  it forms a trumpet like surface  any triangle drawn on this grid will become even more distorted when an apex is near the origin  all the lines going up the surface are asymptotes to a single central line rising vertically from the origin  these lines are all â  parallelâ   lines passing through a single limit point at infinity  tractrix if the tractrix is rotated about its vertical axis  the surface formed will be a complete pseudo sphere  poincare disc model in the poincare model  all â  linesâ   are arcs of circles  except for the diameter  the arc of a circle with infinite radius   â  parallelâ   lines are thought of as asymptotes where the limit point is on the circumference  with this model many â  parallelsâ   can pass through the same point  this disc has a basic four fold symmetry  the yellow poincare disc has symmetry order seven  maurits escher used a six fold symmetry for his â  circle limit ivâ   engraving   the picture with the interlocking angels and devils  for more on escher see  http   www mcescher com  gradually other models helped to make the new ideas more secure and in 1872 the famous german mathematician felix klein  1849 1925  produced his general view of geometry by unifying the different spherical  perspective projective and hyperbolic geometries with others as sets of axioms and properties invariant under the action of certain transformations  in this way  mathematicians at last became free to think of geometry in the abstract as a set of axioms  operations and logical rules that were not tied to the physical world  for

bodies  they have been specially built as part of ancient observatories  and as they became larger had to be supported by solid walls to keep them steady  it was believed that the larger the instrument was  the more accurate were the results obtained  it is true that the larger the instrument is  the easier it is to divide the scale of the quadrant into degrees  minutes and seconds  however  the accuracy can also depend on other things like the sighting instrument  for example  telescopes were not developed well enough to be reliable until the early 18th century  and because the mounting was fixed  it had limited use  in spite of the problems  arab astronomers were able to achieve an accuracy of about 20 seconds of arc  wall quadrant weblinks these are the most reliable and

get   9   b 2   r 2   and   25    4 b  2   r 2    taking the first equation away from the second  and expanding  we find the value of   b      25    4 b  2   9   b 2   0  iff 25   16   8b   b 2   9   b 2   0  iff 32   8b  iff b   4    now  substituting   b 4   into the equation   25    4 b  2   r 2   from above  we get    25   r 2    this is true if  and only if    r   5    we know that   r   must be 5 rather than    5   as the radius of a circle must be positive  so the equation of this circle is    x 5  2    y 4  2   25    method 2 the second way of looking at this problem involves thinking about the circle geometrically  given any three points  we can think of a triangle with these points as its vertices  it is a fact that there is a unique circle passing through these three points  whose centre is the circumcentre of the triangle we just describedâ  that is  the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the three sides  our three points are   a  2 0       b  8 0     and   c  10 4     the line segment between    2 0    and    8 0    is part of the   x   axis  with midpoint     frac 2 8  2   frac 0 0  2    5 0     so the perpendicular bisector of the side   ab   is the line   x 5    the line segment between    8 0    and    10 4    has gradient    frac 4  2  2   and midpoint     frac 8 10  2   frac 0 4  2    9 2     so the perpendicular bisector of side   bc   is the line with gradient    frac  1  2    and passing through the point    9 2   â  substituting this information into the general equation for a line   y mx c   we find that the perpendicular bisector of side bc is the line   y  frac  1  2 x  frac 13  2      we could also calculate the perpendicular bisector of side   ca    which turns out to be the line   y  2x 14    but we donâ  t need to do this  because we are using the standard fact that the three perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle meet at a single point  you could check that this is true in this specific case if you wanted  substituting   x 5   into   y  frac  1  2 x    frac 13  2     we get the equation   y   frac 5  2   frac 13  2    which is true if and only if   y 4    so these two perpendicular bisectors intersect at the point    5 4     making this the centre of the circle  now  it is easy to find the radius of the circleâ  simply find the distance between the centre and one of the points given  the distance between   a  2 0    and    5 4    is    sqrt  2 5  2  0 4  2   sqrt 25  5    so the circle passing through these three points has centre    5 4    and radius   5    this means that it has equation    x 5  2    y 4  2   25     on the   y   axis  we know that   x 0    substituting   x 0   into the equation for this circle  we get    25    y 4  2   25  iff  y 4  2   0    this equation has only one solution    y 4    so the circle touches the   y   axis   setting   x 0   in the equation for the circle gives an equation in   y    if   y d   is a solution to this equation  then the circle intersects the   y   axis at    0 d     if this equation only has one solution  then the circle meets the   y   axis at only one point  and therefore must be at a tangent to it    any line passing through the origin that is not the   y   axis must have equation   y mx   for some real number   m    we want to find an   m   such that   y mx   and    x 5  2  y 4  2 25   intersect at exactly one pointâ  then   y mx   will be a tangent to the circle passing through the origin  substituting   y mx   into    x 5  2  y 4  2 25   and expanding  we get a quadratic equation in   x   with coefficients in   m       x 5  2    mx 4  2   25      iff x 2   10x   25   m 2x 2   8mx   16   25      iff  m 2  1 x 2     10   8m x 16   0    for   y mx   to be a tangent to the circle  we must have only one root to this quadratic equationâ  that is  its discriminant must be zero  now     10 8m  2   4 m 2 1  16    0      iff 100 160m 64m 2 64 m 2 1  0      iff 100 160m 64m 2 64m 2 64 0      iff 160m 36 0      iff m  frac  9  40     the discriminant of a quadratic equation   ax 2 bx c   0   is   b 2 4ac    the discriminant equals zero if  and only if  the equation has a repeated root  so   y  frac  9  40 x   is the equation of this tangent        q4 solution    prove that the line   y mx c   will touch the circle   x 2 y 2 25   if   c 2 25 1 m 2     hence or otherwise find the equations of the two tangents to this circle from the point    2 11       for the line to â  touchâ   the circle there must be exactly one point of intersection between themâ  the line must be a tangent to the circle  to find the points of intersection of the line and circle we need to solve their equations for   x   and   y    substituting   y   mx   c   into   x 2   y 2   25   gives   x 2    mx c  2   25      iff  1 m 2 x 2   2mcx   c 2   25   0    this is a quadratic equation in   x   and has discriminant    2mc  2   4  1 m 2   c 2 25    4  25  1 m 2    c 2     if   c 2   25 1 m 2    then the discriminant is   0    this tells us that there is exactly one value of   x   which satisfies this quadratic and hence the simultaneous equations  since   y   mx   c   is a linear equation in   x    this corresponds to exactly one value of   y    therefore the line and circle intersect at exactly one point   we can save some time by using the first part of the question to solve the next part  we want to find straight lines of the form   y mx c   which go through the the point    2 11    and are tangents to the circle  substituting the coordinates    2 11    into   y mx c   gives   11   2m   c   and from the first part we must have   c 2   25 1 m 2     now we have simultaneous equations for   m   and   c   which we can solve  substituting for   c   gives    11 2m  2   25 1 m 2     which rearranges to give   21m 2   44m   96   0       iff  3m 4   7m 24    0     so   m    frac 4  3    or   m      frac 24  7     if   m    frac 4  3     then   c   11   2  frac 4  3     frac 25  3     and if   m      frac 24  7    then   c   11   2  frac   24   7     frac 125  7     so the two tangents are   y   frac 4  3  x    frac 25  3   and   y     frac 24  7  x    frac 125  7           q5 solution    show that the circles having equations   x 2   y 2   25   and   x 2   y 2   24x   18y   125   0   touch each other  calculate the coordinates of the point at which they touch    for the circles to touch  we must show that they intersect at only one point  we have the equations of the two circles    x 2   y 2   25   and   x 2   y 2   24x   18y   125   0    substituting the first equation into the second gives   25   24x   18y   125   0      rightarrow 24x   18y   150      rightarrow 4x   3y   25    we have shown that if    x y    lies on both circles then it also lies on the line   4x   3y   25    since   4x   3y   25   is a straight line  there are infinitely many points    x y    that satisfy this equation  we need to show that there is only one point on this line that also lies on the two circles  rearrange   4x   3y   25   to get   x    frac 1  4  25 3y    and substitute into equation  1      left  frac 1  4  25 3y  right  2  y 2   25      rightarrow 25y 2   150y   225   0      rightarrow y 2   6y   9   0      rightarrow  y 3  2   0      rightarrow y   3    the quadratic equation has a repeated root  so only has one solution  this means that the line   4x   3y   25   and the circle   x 2   y 2   25   only touch at one point  that is  there is only one point that lies on both the line   4x   3y   25   and the circle   x 2   y 2   25    we can find the corresponding   x   value by setting   y   3   in the equation   4x   3y   25      4x   3 3    25      rightarrow x   4    we can check that the point    4 3    lies on the circle   x 2   y 2   24x   18y   125   0    we have   4 2   3 2   24 4    18 3    125   0    so the circles   x 2   y 2   25   and   x 2   y 2   24x   18y   125   0   touch only at the point    4 3           q6 solution    show by calculation that the point   p       9  3    lies inside the circle   x 2 y 2 4x 8y 80 0    find the equations of the two circles which pass through   p    touch the given circle  and have radii of 5 units    the first thing we want to do is re write the equation of the circle in the form    x a  2  y b  2 r 2   so that we can easily work out its centre and radius    x 2 y 2 4x 8y 80 0      rightarrow   x 2  2   4      y 4  2 16    80  0      rightarrow  x 2  2    y 4  2   100    this circle has centre     2 4    and radius   10    this means that a point   q   lies inside this circle if and only if the distance between   q   and the point     2 4    is less than   10    so  to show that   p   lies inside this circle  we must show that the distance between     9  3    and     2 4    is less than   10    let   d   be the distance between     9  3    and    2 4   then   d    sqrt   9   2   2   3 4  2         sqrt   7  2   7  2         sqrt 49 49         sqrt 98    now    sqrt 98   lt   sqrt 100    10    that is  the distance between p and     2 4    is less than   10    so   p   lies inside the circle   let   c   be a circle of radius   5    passing through   p     9  3    and touching the circle    x 2  2  y 4  2 100    we want to find the centre of   c    call the centre    a b     firstly  as   c   passes through     9  3     and as   c   has radius   5    we know that    a b    and     9  3    are a distance of   5   units apart  so    a b    must lie on the circle    x 9  2  y 3  2 25    and therefore    a 9  2  b 3  2 25    we also know that   c   just touches the circle    x 2  2  y 4  2 100    so the centre of   c       a b     must lie a distance of exactly   5   units away from one point on this circle  and a distance of greater than   5   units away from all other points on this circle  this means that    a b    must lie on one of the faded circles in the diagram below   diagram  we know that    a b    cannot lie on the outer circle because then the distance between    a b    and     9  3    would be greater than   5   units  because     9  3    lies inside the circle  so    a b    must lie on the inner circle  which has equation    x 2  2  y 4  2 25    therefore    a 2  2  b 4  2 25    this means that we now have two equations which    a b    must satisfy     a 9  2  b 3  2 25   and    a 2  2  b 4  2 25    as both of these expressions equal 25  we can equate them to get    a 2  2  b 4  2  a 9  2  b 3  2       rightarrow a 2 4a 4 b 2 8b 16 a 2 18a 81 b 2 6b 9      rightarrow 70  14a 14b      rightarrow b  5 a   substituting   b  5 a   into    a 9  2  b 3  2 25   gives    a 9  2   2 a  2 25       rightarrow a 2 18a 81 4 4a a 2 25      rightarrow a 2 11a 30 0      rightarrow  a 5  a 6  0      rightarrow a    5   or   a  6    substituting these values into   b  5 a    we get two possible values for    a b         5 0    and     6 1     itâ  s easy to check that these points are both possibilities for the centre of   c    they do satisfy both equations   then  as the circles have radius   5    we get that the equations for these two circles are     x 5  2 y 2 25   and    x 6  2  y 1 2  25          q7 solution    find the equations of the two circles which each satisfy the following conditions    i  the axis of  x  is a tangent to the circle    ii  the centre of the circle lies on the line  2y   x     iii  the point   14 2   lies on the circle   prove that the line   3y   4x   is a common tangent to these circles    the general equation of a circle with centre    a b    and radius   r   is    x   a  2    y   b  2   r 2    since the centre lies on the line   2y   x    we have that   2b   a    since the point    14 2    lies on the circle  we can substitute this and   2b   a   into our general equation to get    14   2b  2    2   b  2   r 2   quad   ast    we also know that the   x   axis just touches the circle  so we find their intersection by substituting   y   0   into our equation     x   a  2   b 2   r 2      rightarrow x 2   2ax    a 2   b 2   r 2    0    this is a quadratic in   x    and it only has one solution since we know that the   x   axis is a tangent to the circle  so the discriminant   b 2   4ac   is equal to zero    4a 2   4 a 2   b 2   r 2    0      rightarrow b 2   r 2    there is also a neat way of reaching    b  r   geometrically  the centre is    a b     and the   x   axis is a tangent  so it will touch the circle directly below  or above  the centre  at    a 0     because any tangent of a circle is perpendicular to a radius of that circle   then the distance from this point to the centre is    b     but this is also the radial distance  so    b    r    now we can substitute this into     ast    and solve for   b       14   2b  2    2   b  2   b 2      rightarrow 196   56b   4b 2   4   4b   b 2   b 2      rightarrow 4b 2   60b   200   0      rightarrow b 2   15b   50   0      rightarrow  b   5  b   10    0      rightarrow b   5   or   b   10    finally  using   2b   a   and   b 2   r 2    we have that the two possible solutions are   b   5  a   10  r   5     b   10  a   20  r   10   and so the equations of the two circles are    x   10  2    y   5  2   25   and    x   20  2    y   10  2   100    for the second part of the question  we give two methods  the first uses direct substitution to find where the line intersects the two circles  the second uses the fact that the tangent to the circle will be perpendicular to the radius at that point  and avoids having to deal with quadratics  method 1 for the first circle  expanding and substituting   x    frac 3  4 y   we have   x 2   20x   y 2   10y   100   0   and   x    frac 3  4 y      rightarrow  frac 9  16 y 2   15y   y 2   10y   100   0      rightarrow  frac 25  16 y 2   25y   100   0      rightarrow y 2   16y   64   0      rightarrow  y   8  2   0      rightarrow y   8    now we can use   x    frac 3  4 y   to find that   x   6    this has a single solution  as expected  and so the line is a tangent to the circle  similarly for the second circle    x 2   40x   y 2   20y   400   0   and   x    frac 3  4 y      rightarrow  frac 9  16 y 2   30y   y 2   20y   400   0      rightarrow  frac 25  16 y 2   50y   400   0      rightarrow y 2   32y   196   0      rightarrow  y   16  2   0      rightarrow y   16    again we can use   x    frac 3  4 y   to find the corresponding value of   x    this time   x   12    so the line is also a tangent to this circle  and hence it is a common tangent to both of them  method 2 the tangent line is   3y   4x    that is   y    frac 4  3 x    the radius that passes through the intersection point will be perpendicular to this  so will have gradient    frac  3  4     so the general equation of the line will be   y    frac  3  4 x   c    the centre of the first circle lies on the line  so substituting    10 5    into the general equation gives   5    frac  3  4   times 10   c      rightarrow c    frac 25  2     so the radial line has equation   y    frac  3  4 x    frac 25  2     then the point at which the radial line and the tangent intersect satisfies   3y   4x   and   y    frac  3  4 x    frac 25  2       rightarrow  frac  9  4 x    frac 75  2    4x      rightarrow  9x   150   16x      rightarrow 25x   150      rightarrow x   6      y   8   this is indeed a point on the circle     6   10  2    8   5  2   4 2   3 2   25    hence the line   3y   4x   intersects the radial line at a point on the circle  and so is a tangent line  using the same method for the second circle  we find that the intersection point is    12 16    and so the line is also a tangent to this circle        q8 solution      the point   a   has coordinates    5 16    and the point   b   has coordinates     4 4     the variable point   p   has coordinates    x y    and moves on a path such that   ap   2bp    show that the cartesian equation of the path of   p   is    x   7  2   y 2   100      the point   c   has coordinates    a 0    and the point   d   has coordinates    b 0     the variable point q moves on a path such that   qc   k  times qd    where   k  gt  1    given that the path of   q   is the same as the path of   p    show that    frac a   7  b   7     frac a 2   51  b 2   51     show further that    a   7  b   7    100    in the case   a  neq b         we are told that   ap   2bp    which is the same as    ap  2   4 bp  2    since distances are positive    here we use the formula for the distance   d   between two points    x_1 y_1    and    x_2 y_2     which is   d 2    x_2 x_1  2    y_2 y_1  2    so the above expression becomes    x   5  2    y

line   sv   is now   y    frac ms   nv  s   v x   c    since we know that this goes through   s    we have   ms    frac ms   nv  s   v s   c      iff c   ms    frac ms   nv  s   v s    so the equation of the line   sv   is   y   ms    frac ms   nv  s   v  x   s     this meets the line   y   0   at the point    p 0     so we know that   p   satisfies    ms    frac ms   nv  s   v  p   s     then

about the gradient of the line  which is what   m   represents  as â  the change in   y   over the change in   x  â    so we have   m    frac 0 b  a 0     frac  b  a     so the equation of the line ab is   y    frac  b  a x   b    this line has gradient    frac  b  a     so the line   np    which is perpendicular to it  has gradient    frac a  b     so   np   has equation   y    frac a  b x   k

frac bt   as  b     now we know that   ab   and   np   intersect at   n    so to find the coordinates of   n   we solve the simultaneous equations   y    frac  b  a x   b   and   y    frac a  b x    frac bt   as  b     if we set them equal to each other we have    frac  b  a x   b    frac a  b x    frac bt   as  b       iff b    frac bt   as  b      frac a  b     frac b  a  x      iff b    frac

assume that    left  frac t   b  s  right  left  frac t  s   a  right     1    note that this means that   s  neq 0    the points   x   and   y   have coordinates    s 0    and    0 t    respectively  so by relabelling of the equation of   ab   we have that the equation of the line   xy   is   y    frac  t  s x   t    now   n   lies on this line exactly when    frac a 2b   b bt   as   a 2   b 2

left  frac t  s   a  right     1   then   n   lies on the line   xy     a geometrical interpretation of this result is that    frac t   b  s    and    frac t  s   a    are the gradients of   bp   and

solving the simultaneous equations    x   2  2   2y 2   18   and   9 x   1  2   16y 2   25    we can eliminate   y   by multiplying the first equation by   8   and subtracting the second equation from

will have   y 2   equal to a negative number  hence there are two points of intersection  at    2 1    and    2  1     suppose a circle through these points has centre    p q    and radius   r    then the equation of the circle is    x   p  2    y   q  2   r 2    setting    x y     2 1    and    x y     2  1    gives two equations     2   p  2    1   q  2   r 2   and    2   p  2     1   q  2   r 2

must lie on the   y   axis  hence the equation of any circle passing through the intersections is    x   p  2   y 2   r 2    this   r   is the same for any point on the circle  so we can replace   r 2   by    x   p  2   y 2   for any specific point    x y    on the circle  such as    2  1     thus    x   p  2   y 2    2   p  2   1    relabelling   p   as   a   and simplifying gives   x 2   2ax   a

circle from the origin    we can think about solving the first part of this problem in two ways  the first involves thinking about the algebraic equation of a circle  method 1 the general equation of a circle with radius   r   and centre    a b    is    x a  2    y b  2   r 2    substituting    x y     2 0        x y     8 0    and    x y     10 4    into this equation for a circle  we get three simultaneous equations in   a      b   and   r       2 a  2   b 2   r 2   and    8 a  2   b 2   r 2   and    10 a  2    4 b  2   r 2    taking the first equation away from the second  and expanding  we find the value of a     8 a  2    2 a  2   0  iff 64   16a   a 2   4   4a   a 2  iff 60   12a  iff a   5    substituting   a 5   into the second and third equations  we get   9   b 2   r 2   and   25    4 b  2   r 2    taking the first equation away from the second  and expanding  we find the value of   b      25    4 b  2   9   b 2   0  iff 25   16   8b   b 2   9   b 2   0  iff 32   8b  iff b   4    now  substituting   b 4   into the equation   25    4 b  2   r 2   from above  we get    25   r 2    this is true if  and only if    r   5    we know that   r   must be 5 rather than    5   as the radius of a circle must be positive  so the equation of this circle is    x 5  2    y 4  2   25    method 2 the second way of looking at this problem involves thinking about the circle geometrically  given any three points  we can think of a triangle with these points as its vertices  it is a fact that there is a unique circle passing through these three points  whose centre is the circumcentre of the triangle we just describedâ  that is  the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the three sides  our three points are   a  2 0       b  8 0     and   c  10 4     the line segment between    2 0    and    8 0    is part of the   x   axis  with midpoint    left  frac 2 8  2   frac 0 0  2  right   5 0     so the perpendicular bisector of the side   ab   is the line   x 5    the line segment between    8 0    and    10 4    has gradient    frac 4  2  2   and midpoint    left  frac 8 10  2   frac 0 4  2  right   9 2     so the perpendicular bisector of side   bc   is the line with gradient    frac  1  2    and passing through the point    9 2   â  substituting this information into the general equation for a line   y mx c   we find that the perpendicular bisector of side bc is the line   y  frac  1  2 x  frac 13  2      we could also calculate the perpendicular bisector of side   ca    which turns out to be the line   y  2x 14    but we donâ  t need to do this  because we are using the standard fact that the three perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle meet at a single point  you could check that this is true in this specific case if you wanted  substituting   x 5   into   y  frac  1  2 x    frac 13  2     we get the equation   y   frac 5  2   frac 13  2    which is true if and only if   y 4    so these two perpendicular bisectors intersect at the point    5 4     making this the centre of the circle  now  it is easy to find the radius of the circleâ  simply find the distance between the centre and one of the points given  the distance between   a  2 0    and    5 4    is    sqrt  2 5  2  0 4  2   sqrt 25  5    so the circle passing through these three points has centre    5 4    and radius   5    this means that it has equation    x 5  2    y 4  2   25     on the   y   axis  we know that   x 0    substituting   x 0   into the equation for this circle  we get    25    y 4  2   25  iff  y 4  2   0    this equation has only one solution    y 4    so the circle touches the   y   axis  setting   x 0   in the equation for the circle gives an equation in   y    if   y d   is a solution to this equation  then the circle intersects the   y   axis at    0 d     if this equation only has one solution  then the circle meets the   y   axis at only one point  and therefore must be at a tangent to it   any line passing through the origin that is not the   y   axis must have equation   y mx   for some real number   m    we want to find an   m   such that   y mx   and    x 5  2  y 4  2 25   intersect at exactly one pointâ  then   y mx   will be a tangent to the circle passing through the origin  substituting   y mx   into    x 5  2  y 4  2 25   and expanding  we get a quadratic equation in   x   with coefficients in   m       x 5  2    mx 4  2   25      iff x 2   10x   25   m 2x 2   8mx   16   25      iff  m 2  1 x 2     10   8m x 16   0    for   y mx   to be a tangent to the circle  we must have only one root to this quadratic equationâ  that is  its discriminant must be zero  the discriminant of a quadratic equation   ax 2 bx c   0   is   b 2 4ac    the discriminant equals zero if  and only if  the equation has a repeated root  now     10 8m  2   4 m 2 1  16    0      iff 100 160m 64m 2 64 m 2 1  0      iff 100 160m 64m 2 64m 2 64 0      iff 160m 36 0      iff m  frac  9  40     so   y  frac  9  40 x   is the equation of this tangent        q4 solution    prove that the line   y mx c   will touch the circle   x 2 y 2 25   if   c 2 25 1 m 2     hence or otherwise find the equations of the two tangents to this circle from the point    2 11       for the line to â  touchâ   the circle there must be exactly one point of intersection between themâ  the line must be a tangent to the circle  to find the points of intersection of the line and circle we need to solve their equations for   x   and   y    substituting   y   mx   c   into   x 2   y 2   25   gives   x 2    mx c  2   25      iff  1 m 2 x 2   2mcx   c 2   25   0    this is a quadratic equation in   x   and has discriminant    2mc  2   4  1 m 2   c 2 25    4  25  1 m 2    c 2     if   c 2   25 1 m 2    then the discriminant is   0    this tells us that there is exactly one value of   x   which satisfies this quadratic and hence the simultaneous equations  since   y   mx   c   is a linear equation in   x    this corresponds to exactly one value of   y    therefore the line and circle intersect at exactly one point   we can save some time by using the first part of the question to solve the next part  we want to find straight lines of the form   y mx c   which go through the the point    2 11    and are tangents to the circle  substituting the coordinates    2 11    into   y mx c   gives   11   2m   c   and from the first part we must have   c 2   25 1 m 2     now we have simultaneous equations for   m   and   c   which we can solve  substituting for   c   gives    11 2m  2   25 1 m 2     which rearranges to give   21m 2   44m   96   0       iff  3m 4   7m 24    0     so   m    frac 4  3    or   m      frac 24  7     if   m    frac 4  3     then   c   11   2  frac 4  3     frac 25  3     and if   m      frac 24  7    then   c   11   2  frac   24   7     frac 125  7     so the two tangents are   y   frac 4  3  x    frac 25  3   and   y     frac 24  7  x    frac 125  7           q5 solution    show that the circles having equations   x 2   y 2   25   and   x 2   y 2   24x   18y   125   0   touch each other  calculate the coordinates of the point at which they touch    for the circles to touch  we must show that they intersect at only one point  we have the equations of the two circles    x 2   y 2   25   and   x 2   y 2   24x   18y   125   0    substituting the first equation into the second gives   25   24x   18y   125   0      rightarrow 24x   18y   150      rightarrow 4x   3y   25    we have shown that if    x y    lies on both circles then it also lies on the line   4x   3y   25    since   4x   3y   25   is a straight line  there are infinitely many points    x y    that satisfy this equation  we need to show that there is only one point on this line that also lies on the two circles  rearrange   4x   3y   25   to get   x    frac 1  4  25 3y    and substitute into equation  1      left  frac 1  4  25 3y  right  2  y 2   25      rightarrow 25y 2   150y   225   0      rightarrow y 2   6y   9   0      rightarrow  y 3  2   0      rightarrow y   3    the quadratic equation has a repeated root  so only has one solution  this means that the line   4x   3y   25   and the circle   x 2   y 2   25   only touch at one point  that is  there is only one point that lies on both the line   4x   3y   25   and the circle   x 2   y 2   25    we can find the corresponding   x   value by setting   y   3   in the equation   4x   3y   25      4x   3 3    25      rightarrow x   4    we can check that the point    4 3    lies on the circle   x 2   y 2   24x   18y   125   0    we have   4 2   3 2   24 4    18 3    125   0    so the circles   x 2   y 2   25   and   x 2   y 2   24x   18y   125   0   touch only at the point    4 3           q6 solution    show by calculation that the point   p       9  3    lies inside the circle   x 2 y 2 4x 8y 80 0    find the equations of the two circles which pass through   p    touch the given circle  and have radii of 5 units    the first thing we want to do is re write the equation of the circle in the form    x a  2  y b  2 r 2   so that we can easily work out its centre and radius    x 2 y 2 4x 8y 80 0      rightarrow   x 2  2   4      y 4  2 16    80  0      rightarrow  x 2  2    y 4  2   100    this circle has centre     2 4    and radius   10    this means that a point   q   lies inside this circle if and only if the distance between   q   and the point     2 4    is less than   10    so  to show that   p   lies inside this circle  we must show that the distance between     9  3    and     2 4    is less than   10    let   d   be the distance between     9  3    and    2 4   then   d    sqrt   9   2   2   3 4  2         sqrt   7  2   7  2         sqrt 49 49         sqrt 98    now    sqrt 98   lt   sqrt 100    10    that is  the distance between p and     2 4    is less than   10    so   p   lies inside the circle   let   c   be a circle of radius   5    passing through   p     9  3    and touching the circle    x 2  2  y 4  2 100    we want to find the centre of   c    call the centre    a b     firstly  as   c   passes through     9  3     and as   c   has radius   5    we know that    a b    and     9  3    are a distance of   5   units apart  so    a b    must lie on the circle    x 9  2  y 3  2 25    and therefore    a 9  2  b 3  2 25    we also know that   c   just touches the circle    x 2  2  y 4  2 100    so the centre of   c       a b     must lie a distance of exactly   5   units away from one point on this circle  and a distance of greater than   5   units away from all other points on this circle  this means that    a b    must lie on one of the faded circles in the diagram below   diagram  we know that    a b    cannot lie on the outer circle because then the distance between    a b    and     9  3    would be greater than   5   units  because     9  3    lies inside the circle  so    a b    must lie on the inner circle  which has equation    x 2  2  y 4  2 25    therefore    a 2  2  b 4  2 25    this means that we now have two equations which    a b    must satisfy     a 9  2  b 3  2 25   and    a 2  2  b 4  2 25    as both of these expressions equal 25  we can equate them to get    a 2  2  b 4  2  a 9  2  b 3  2       rightarrow a 2 4a 4 b 2 8b 16 a 2 18a 81 b 2 6b 9      rightarrow 70  14a 14b      rightarrow b  5 a   substituting   b  5 a   into    a 9  2  b 3  2 25   gives    a 9  2   2 a  2 25       rightarrow a 2 18a 81 4 4a a 2 25      rightarrow a 2 11a 30 0      rightarrow  a 5  a 6  0      rightarrow a    5   or   a  6    substituting these values into   b  5 a    we get two possible values for    a b         5 0    and     6 1     itâ  s easy to check that these points are both possibilities for the centre of   c    they do satisfy both equations   then  as the circles have radius   5    we get that the equations for these two circles are     x 5  2 y 2 25   and    x 6  2  y 1 2  25          q7 solution    find the equations of the two circles which each satisfy the following conditions    the axis of   x   is a tangent to the circle    the centre of the circle lies on the line   2y   x      the point    14 2    lies on the circle    prove that the line   3y   4x   is a common tangent to these circles    the general equation of a circle with centre    a b    and radius   r   is    x   a  2    y   b  2   r 2    since the centre lies on the line   2y   x    we have that   2b   a    since the point    14 2    lies on the circle  we can substitute this and   2b   a   into our general equation to get    14   2b  2    2   b  2   r 2   quad   ast    we also know that the   x   axis just touches the circle  so we find their intersection by substituting   y   0   into our equation     x   a  2   b 2   r 2      rightarrow x 2   2ax    a 2   b 2   r 2    0    this is a quadratic in   x    and it only has one solution since we know that the   x   axis is a tangent to the circle  so the discriminant   b 2   4ac   is equal to zero    4a 2   4 a 2   b 2   r 2    0      rightarrow b 2   r 2    there is also a neat way of reaching    b  r   geometrically  the centre is    a b     and the   x   axis is a tangent  so it will touch the circle directly below  or above  the centre  at    a 0     because any tangent of a circle is perpendicular to a radius of that circle   then the distance from this point to the centre is    b     but this is also the radial distance  so    b    r    now we can substitute this into     ast    and solve for   b       14   2b  2    2   b  2   b 2      rightarrow 196   56b   4b 2   4   4b   b 2   b 2      rightarrow 4b 2   60b   200   0      rightarrow b 2   15b   50   0      rightarrow  b   5  b   10    0      rightarrow b   5   or   b   10    finally  using   2b   a   and   b 2   r 2    we have that the two possible solutions are   b   5  a   10  r   5     b   10  a   20  r   10   and so the equations of the two circles are    x   10  2    y   5  2   25   and    x   20  2    y   10  2   100    for the second part of the question  we give two methods  the first uses direct substitution to find where the line intersects the two circles  the second uses the fact that the tangent to the circle will be perpendicular to the radius at that point  and avoids having to deal with quadratics  method 1 for the first circle  expanding and substituting   x    frac 3  4 y   we have   x 2   20x   y 2   10y   100   0   and   x    frac 3  4 y      rightarrow  frac 9  16 y 2   15y   y 2   10y   100   0      rightarrow  frac 25  16 y 2   25y   100   0      rightarrow y 2   16y   64   0      rightarrow  y   8  2   0      rightarrow y   8    now we can use   x    frac 3  4 y   to find that   x   6    this has a single solution  as expected  and so the line is a tangent to the circle  similarly for the second circle    x 2   40x   y 2   20y   400   0   and   x    frac 3  4 y      rightarrow  frac 9  16 y 2   30y   y 2   20y   400   0      rightarrow  frac 25  16 y 2   50y   400   0      rightarrow y 2   32y   196   0      rightarrow  y   16  2   0      rightarrow y   16    again we can use   x    frac 3  4 y   to find the corresponding value of   x    this time   x   12    so the line is also a tangent to this circle  and hence it is a common tangent to both of them  method 2 the tangent line is   3y   4x    that is   y    frac 4  3 x    the radius that passes through the intersection point will be perpendicular to this  so will have gradient    frac  3  4     so the general equation of the line will be   y    frac  3  4 x   c    the centre of the first circle lies on the line  so substituting    10 5    into the general equation gives   5    frac  3  4   times 10   c      rightarrow c    frac 25  2     so the radial line has equation   y    frac  3  4 x    frac 25  2     then the point at which the radial line and the tangent intersect satisfies   3y   4x   and   y    frac  3  4 x    frac 25  2       rightarrow  frac  9  4 x    frac 75  2    4x      rightarrow  9x   150   16x      rightarrow 25x   150      rightarrow x   6      y   8   this is indeed a point on the circle     6   10  2    8   5  2   4 2   3 2   25    hence the line   3y   4x   intersects the radial line at a point on the circle  and so is a tangent line  using the same method for the second circle  we find that the intersection point is    12 16    and so the line is also a tangent to this circle        q8 solution      the point   a   has coordinates    5 16    and the point   b   has coordinates     4 4     the variable point   p   has coordinates    x y    and moves on a path such that   ap   2bp    show that the cartesian equation of the path of   p   is    x   7  2   y 2   100      the point   c   has coordinates    a 0    and the point   d   has coordinates    b 0     the variable point q moves on a path such that   qc   k  times qd    where   k  gt  1    given that the path of   q   is the same as the path of   p    show that    frac a   7  b   7     frac a 2   51  b 2   51     show further that    a   7  b   7    100    in the case   a  neq b         we are told that   ap   2bp    which is the same as    ap  2   4 bp  2    since distances are positive    we use the formula for the distance   d   between two points    x_1 y_1    and    x_2 y_2     which is   d 2    x_2 x_1  2    y_2 y_1  2    so the above expression becomes    x   5  2    y   16  2   4  x   4  2    y   4  2       iff x 2   y 2   10x   32y   281   4x 2   4y 2   32x   32y   128      iff 3x 2   3y 2   42x   153   0      iff x 2   y 2   14x   51   0      iff  x   7  2   49   y 2   51   0      iff  x   7  2   y 2   100    this is the equation of a circle with centre     7 0    and radius   10      using the same approach as in part  i   we have     qc  2   k 2  times  qd  2      iff  x   a  2   y 2   k 2 x   b  2   k 2y 2      iff x 2   2ax   a 2   y 2   k 2 x 2   2bk 2 x   b 2 k 2   k 2 y 2      iff x 2 k 2   1    y 2 k 2   1    x 2a   2b k 2     b 2 k 2   a 2    0    if this locus is the same as the locus of   p    then the ratios of the coefficients must be the same  so    frac 2a   2b k 2  k 2   1    14   and    frac b 2 k 2   a 2  k 2   1     51    note that we cannot conclude that   k 2   1   1    and must instead divide by it to make the coefficients of the   x 2   and   y 2   terms equal to 1  the first of these gives   2a   2b k 2   14k 2   14    so   k 2    frac a   7  b   7     similarly  the second rearranges to   b 2 k 2   a 2    51k 2   51    so   k 2    frac a 2   51  b 2   51     thus    frac a   7  b   7     frac a 2   51  b 2   51     now we can rearrange this to    a   7  b 2   51     b   7  a 2   51       iff ab 2   7b 2   51a   a 2b   7a 2   51b      iff ab 2   a 2b   7 a 2   b 2    51 b   a       iff ab b   a    7 a   b  a   b    51 b   a     since   a  neq b    we may divide by   b a   to obtain   ab   51   7 a   b     that is    ab   7 a   b    51      rightarrow ab   7 a   b    49   51   49      rightarrow  a   7  b   7    100          q9 solution    the points   s      t      u   and   v   have coordinates    s ms        t mt        u nu    and    v nv    respectively  the lines   sv   and   ut   meet the line   y   0   at the

think about the gradient of the line  which is what   a   represents  as â  the change in   y   over the change in   x  â    so we have   a    frac nv   ms  v   s     the equation of the line   sv   is now   y    frac ms   nv  s   v x   c    since we know that this goes through   s    we have   ms    frac ms   nv  s   v s   c      iff c   ms    frac ms   nv  s   v s    so the equation of the line

gives the required result for   p    we have   p   s    frac ms v s   ms   nv       iff p    frac s ms   nv    ms v s   ms   nv       iff p    frac  m n sv  ms   nv     relabelling   p  mapsto q

dividing by   0    since   s   and   t   lie on the circle    s   and   t   are solutions of the equation    lambda 2    m lambda   c  2   r 2      iff  1   m 2  lambda 2   2mc lambda    c 2   r 2

frac  b  a x   b    this line has gradient    frac  b  a     so the line   np    which is perpendicular to it  has gradient    frac a  b     so   np   has equation   y    frac a  b x   k   for some

have   y 2   equal to a negative number  hence there are two points of intersection  at    2 1    and    2  1     suppose a circle through these points has centre    p q    and radius   r    then the

must lie on the   y   axis  hence the equation of any circle passing through the intersections is    x   p  2   y 2   r 2    this   r   is the same for any point on the circle  so we can replace   r 2   by    x   p  2   y 2   for any specific point    x y    on the circle  such as    2  1     thus    x   p  2   y 2    2   p  2   1    relabelling   p   as   a   and simplifying gives   x 2   2ax   a

 we know that   r   must be 5 rather than    5   as the radius of a circle must be positive  so the equation of this circle is    x 5  2    y 4  2   25    method 2 the second way of looking at this problem involves thinking about the circle geometrically  given any three points  we can think of a triangle with these points as its vertices  it is a fact that there is a unique circle passing through these three points  whose centre is the circumcentre of the triangle we just describedâ  that is  the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the three sides  our three points are   a  2 0       b  8 0     and   c  10 4     the line segment between    2 0    and    8 0    is part of the   x   axis  with midpoint    left  frac 2 8  2   frac 0 0  2  right   5 0     so the perpendicular bisector of the side   ab   is the line   x 5    the line segment between    8 0    and    10 4    has gradient    frac 4  2  2   and midpoint    left  frac 8 10  2   frac 0 4  2  right   9 2     so the perpendicular bisector of side   bc   is the line with gradient    frac  1  2    and passing through the point    9 2     substituting this information into the general equation for a line   y mx c    we find that the perpendicular bisector of side bc is the line   y  frac  1  2 x  frac 13  2      we could also calculate the perpendicular bisector of side   ca    which turns out to be the line   y  2x 14    but we donâ  t need to do this  because we are using the standard fact that the three perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle meet at a single point  you could check that this is true in this specific case if you wanted  substituting   x 5   into   y  frac  1  2 x    frac 13  2     we get the equation   y   frac 5  2   frac 13  2    which is true if and only if   y 4    so these two perpendicular bisectors intersect at the point    5 4     making this the centre of the circle  now  it is easy to find the radius of the circleâ  simply find the distance between the centre and one of the points given  the distance between   a  2 0    and    5 4    is    sqrt  2 5  2  0 4  2   sqrt 25  5    so the circle passing through these three points has centre    5 4    and radius   5    this means that it has equation    x 5  2    y 4  2   25     on the   y   axis  we know that   x 0    substituting   x 0   into the equation for this circle  we get    25    y 4  2   25  iff  y 4  2   0    this equation has only one solution    y 4    so the circle touches the   y   axis  setting   x 0   in the equation for the circle gives an equation in   y    if   y d   is a solution to this equation  then the circle intersects the   y   axis at    0 d     if this equation only has one solution  then the circle meets the   y   axis at only one point  and therefore the   y   axis must be a tangent to the circle   any line passing through the origin that is not the   y   axis must have equation   y mx   for some real number   m    we want to find an   m   such that   y mx   and    x 5  2  y 4  2 25   intersect at exactly one pointâ  then   y mx   will be a tangent to the circle passing through the origin  substituting   y mx   into    x 5  2  y 4  2 25   and expanding  we get a quadratic equation in   x   with coefficients in   m       x 5  2    mx 4  2   25      iff x 2   10x   25   m 2x 2   8mx   16   25      iff  m 2  1 x 2     10   8m x 16   0    for   y mx   to be a tangent to the circle  we must have only one root to this quadratic equationâ  that is  its discriminant must be zero  the discriminant of a quadratic equation   ax 2 bx c   0   is   b 2 4ac    the discriminant equals zero if  and only if  the equation has a repeated root  now     10 8m  2   4 m 2 1  16    0      iff 100 160m 64m 2 64 m 2 1  0      iff 100 160m 64m 2 64m 2 64

   the general equation of a circle with centre    a b    and radius   r   is    x   a  2    y   b  2   r 2    since the centre lies on the line   2y   x    we have that   2b   a    since the point

also a neat way of reaching    b  r   geometrically  the centre is    a b     and the   x   axis is a tangent  so it will touch the circle directly below  or above  the centre  at    a 0     because any tangent of a circle is perpendicular to a radius of that circle   then the distance from this point to the centre is    b     but this is also the radial distance  so    b    r    now we can substitute this into     ast    and solve for   b       14   2b  2    2   b  2   b 2      iff 196   56b   4b 2   4   4b   b 2   b 2      iff 4b 2   60b   200   0      iff b 2   15b   50   0      iff  b   5  b   10    0      iff b   5  or  b   10    finally  using   2b   a   and   b 2   r 2    we have that the two possible solutions are   b   5   quad a   10   quad r   5   and   b   10   quad a   20   quad r   10   and so the equations of the two circles are    x   10  2    y   5  2   25   and    x   20  2    y   10  2   100    for the second part of the question  we give two methods  the first uses direct substitution to find where the line intersects the two circles  the second uses the fact that the tangent to the circle will be perpendicular to the radius at that point  and avoids having to deal with quadratics  method 1 for the first circle  expanding and substituting   x    frac 3  4 y   we have   x 2   20x   y 2   10y   100   0  and  x    frac 3  4 y      rightarrow  frac 9

  16    again we can use   x    frac 3  4 y   to find the corresponding value of   x    this time   x   12    so the line is also a tangent to this circle  and hence it is a common tangent to both of them  method 2 the tangent line is   3y   4x    that is   y    frac 4  3 x    the radius that passes through the intersection point will be perpendicular to this  so will have gradient    frac  3  4

  and the given line is    left  frac 3  5 h  frac 4  5 k  frac 28  5  right     since the distance between    h k    and    4 4    is   5   we can see that    1 leq h      k leq9    therefore     frac 67  5   leq frac 3  5 h  frac 4  5 k  frac 28  5  leq  frac 3  5     since we want the numerical value of     frac 3  5 h  frac 4  5 k  frac 28  5     to be   5   and the interval      frac 67  5   frac 3  5     includes    5   but not   5    we must find   h   and   k   so that    frac 3  5 h  frac 4  5 k  frac 28  5   5    so   h 1  frac 4  3 k    since the distance between    h k    and

picture cartesian coordinates    how do you remember the spot on a desert island where you buried your treasure  you pick a landmark  say a palm tree  and measure how many steps north south and how many steps east west you have to go from that landmark to get to the treasure  itâ  s a simple idea but  surprisingly  mathematicians took centuries to develop its full potential in their own field  when they finally did  it revolutionised mathematics by bringing together two areas that on the face of it have little to do with each other  algebra and geometry  when we start learning geometry we usually think of simple shapes like lines  triangles and circles in the two dimensional plane  you can construct these and more complicated shapes using a ruler  compasses and protractor  the ancient greeks were masters at this type of geometry  using just compasses and a straight edge  an unmarked ruler  they were able to construct a range of shapes and they could even prove mathematical results  such as pythagorasâ   theorem  using these simple tools  there are certain things  however  that you cannot do using these basic methods  two shapes  say a line and a circle  may or may not intersect  and they may intersect in different ways  perhaps the line just touches the circle  perhaps it shaves a little arc off it  or perhaps it cuts it in half  to record this information you need a way of describing the locations of the shapes     figure 1     figure 2     figure 3    this is where the treasure island idea comes in useful  it illustrates what is called the cartesian coordinate system  choose a point in the plane  called the origin  and draw two perpendicular axes through it  one horizontal and one vertical  any point in the plane can be reached from the origin by travelling a certain distance   x   along the horizontal axis and a certain distance   y   along the vertical axis  the numbers    x y    are the coordinates of the point  the origin itself has coordinates    0 0     the part of the horizontal axis  also called the   x   axis  that lies to the left of the origin and the part of the vertical axis  the   y   axis  below the origin are described by negative numbers  cartesian coordinates are named after the 17th century french philosopher and mathematician renã  descartes  there is a  probably untrue  story that descartes invented these coordinates while lying in bed watching a fly on the ceiling and wondering how to describe its location  descartesâ   penchant for lying in bed until noon may actually have been the cause of his demise  which occurred in stockholm in 1650  descartes was in sweden to act as maths tutor to queen christina  who unfortunately preferred to work early in the morning  according to some reports it was these early hours and the scandinavian temperatures which caused the pneumonia that eventually killed him  others have suggested that he was poisoned by a catholic priest worried about descartesâ   radical theology  either way  the cartesian coordinate system is one of descartesâ   most important legacies  although he was not the only person to have the idea   it allows us to answer geometric problems using algebra and to visualise algebraic relationships that would otherwise remain quite abstract  take for example the equation   y   2x 1    we can plot the graph of this function in a cartesian coordinate system by plotting all points whose coordinates are of the form    x 2x 1     points such as    0   1        1  1        2 3         1  3         2  5          frac 1  2    2     and    1 73  2 46     in this case the graph is a straight line that meets the   y   axis at the point    0  1    and has a slope of   2     figure 4  more generally every straight line is given by an equation of the form   y mx b    where   m   gives you the slope of the line and    0 b    is the point at which it crosses the   y   axis  a vertical line which doesnâ  t cross the   y   axis is given by an equation of the form   x c    in this case    c 0    is the point at which it crosses the   x   axis  what about a circle  a circle consists of all those points that lie at equal distance   r   from a given point   m    letâ  s suppose that   m   is the point    0 0     from pythagorasâ   theorem we know that if a point    x  y    lies at distance   r   from    0 0     then   x 2 y 2 r 2     figure 5  this therefore is the equation of a circle of radius   r   centred on the origin  you can work out for yourself that a circle of radius   r   centred on the point    a b    has the equation    x a  2    y b  2   r 2    but here is a more complicated question  what shape do you get when you consider all points that lie at equal distance from a given point and a given line  without a coordinate system  you might draw the point and the line and experiment with your ruler or compasses  you could draw a few points that lie at an equal distance from both and see if you can guess the overall shape  armed with a coordinate system  though  the answer becomes a lot easier and much more precise  suppose that the given point is at distance   1   from the given line  letâ  s place the given point at the origin and the given line so that it is horizontal  given by the equation   y  1    by pythagorasâ   theorem the distance of any point    x y    from    0 0    is    sqrt x 2   y 2     the distance from a point    x y    to the line   y    1   is    y 1     we use the modulus here because the   y   coordinate might be negative   if those two are equal  then    y 1     sqrt x 2   y 2     squaring both sides gives   y 2   2y  1   x 2   y 2   rearranging gives   y    frac x 2  2     frac 1  2     so any point at equal distance from the point    0 0    and the line   y  1   has coordinates    left x   frac x 2  2     frac 1  2  right     you can check for yourself that the converse is also true  every point with these coordinates lies at equal distance from the the point    0 0    and the line   y  1     figure 6  we can plot the graph of this function to see the required shape  which turns out to be a parabola  in fact  every quadratic function   y   ax 2   bx   c   for   a      b   and   c   constants  gives us a parabola  this familiar shape  which can come in so many subtle variationsâ  long and thin or squat and flatâ  is captured by this handy algebraic expression  the fact that today the terms â  quadratic functionâ   and â  parabolaâ   are almost considered synonymous highlights just how successful descartesâ   idea has been  more generally  any algebraic relationship between two variables   x   and   y   gives us a curve that we can plot using cartesian coordinates    figure 7   the algebraic representation makes it easy to answer a whole range of geometric questions  to work out the intersection points of the line given by   y   x   and the parabola above we simply note that the   y   coordinate of any point    x y    lying on both must satisfy both equations  so   y   x    frac x 2  2     frac 1  2     this gives   x 2   2x   1   0    solving the quadratic equation we get   x   1  sqrt 2    and   x   1  sqrt 2     so the points of intersection are at    1  sqrt 2  1  sqrt 2    textrm  and    1  sqrt 2  1  sqrt 2      apart from solving geometric problems  cartesian coordinates also help visualise algebraic relationships  for example  suppose a car is travelling at speed   u   and the driver is applying the brakes  resulting in a constant deceleration of  for example     4   metres seconds   2    the stopping distance   s  â  the distance the car covers before it come to a haltâ  is given by the algebraic relationship   s     frac u 2  2  times   4      frac u 2  8     plotting this using cartesian coordinates brings home just how important it is to slow down in urban areas  because the stopping distance increases rapidly with   u     figure 8  in this example we knew the relationship between two variables because it can be derived from the laws of physics  but cartesian coordinates are also useful when you suspect that two variables are related but you donâ  t know how  suppose we think that there is a relationship between the profit made by an ice cream seller and the outside temperature  to find out what that relationship might be  we can measure temperature and profit over  say  the course of a year and plot the values against each other  with temperature recorded on the   x   axis and profit on the   y   axis  we can then see whether we can spot a pattern  in figure 9 we might guess that the relationship is linear  and we can try to find the straight line   y mx b   that best fits our data  there are methods for finding this best fit   in figure 10 we might guess that the relationship is quadratic and again we can try to find the function   y   ax 2   bx   c   that best fits the data   figure 9   figure 10  cartesian coordinates played a major role in the development of calculus in the second half of the 17th century  calculus makes it possible to work out attributes of curves such as their slope at a given point or the area of the region that lies between a curve and the   x   axis  these can have physical interpretations too  for example  if we plot the distance a car travels against the time it has been travelling  the slope of the resulting curve at a given timeâ  the rate of change of distance with respect to timeâ  represents the speed at which the car was travelling at that moment in time  it is the derivative of the function that gives us distance in terms of time  we can also go up a dimension by considering a third axis perpendicular to the first two  which you can imagine as coming out of your sheet of paper and pointing at you  using such a three dimensional system you can now represent three dimensional objects and visualise how a third variable   z   depends on your first two    x   and   y    these examples should give you some sense of why coordinates have become so indispensable in all areas of science  from physics to astronomy and engineering  and also in visual industries to produce computer graphics or the computer generated imagery we admire in movies and games  in mathematics itself the link between algebra and geometry has culminated in a whole area called algebraic geometry  which holds a fascination of its own  perhaps the most famous result that has emerged from this area is fermatâ  s last theorem  named after a contemporary of descartes  pierre de fermat  who also contributed significantly to the development of the cartesian coordinate system  fermat was considering a question that links geometry to number theory  according to pythagorasâ   theorem  if   a      b   and   c   are the sides of a right angled triangle and   c   is the side opposite the right angle  then   a 2   b 2   c 2    there are infinitely many triples of whole numbers   a      b   and   c   which satisfy this relationship     3 4 5    is an example  now suppose we change the exponent and consider expressions such as   a 3 b 3 c 3   and   a 4 b 4 c 4   and more generally   a n b n c n   where   n   is a natural number greater than 2  can we still find positive whole numbers   a      b   and   c   satisfying the equation  fermat suspected that we canâ  t and he scribbled as much in the margin of his maths text book  saying he had a â  marvellous proofâ   for that fact which the margin was too narrow to contain  that scribble was to haunt mathematicians for over 350 years  it was not until 1993 that a proof of this seemingly innocuous result was finally announced by the mathematician andrew wiles  wiles had made extensive use of algebraic geometry  in particular  he had used results concerning the elliptic curves described by points in the plane

guide         the bigger picture cartesian coordinates    how do you remember the spot on a desert island where you buried your treasure  you pick a landmark  say a palm tree  and measure how many steps north south and how many steps east west you have to go from that landmark to get to the treasure  itâ  s a simple idea but  surprisingly  mathematicians took centuries to develop its full potential in their own field  when they finally did  it revolutionised mathematics by bringing together two areas that on the face of it have little to do with each other  algebra and geometry  when we start learning geometry we usually think of simple shapes like lines  triangles and circles in the two dimensional plane  you can construct these and more complicated shapes using a ruler  compasses and protractor  the ancient greeks were masters at this type of geometry  using just compasses and a straight edge  an unmarked ruler  they were able to construct a range of shapes and they could even prove mathematical results  such as pythagorasâ  s theorem  using these simple tools  there are certain things  however  that you cannot do using these basic methods  two shapes  say a line and a circle  may or may not intersect  and they may intersect in different ways  perhaps the line just touches the circle  perhaps it shaves a little arc off it  or perhaps it cuts it in half  to record this information you need a way of describing the locations of the shapes     figure 1     figure 2     figure 3    this is where the treasure island idea comes in useful  it illustrates what is called the cartesian coordinate system  choose a point in the plane  called the origin  and draw two perpendicular axes through it  one horizontal and one vertical  any point in the plane can be reached from the origin by travelling a certain distance   x   along the horizontal axis and a certain distance   y   along the vertical axis  the numbers    x y    are the coordinates of the point  the origin itself has coordinates    0 0     the part of the horizontal axis  also called the   x   axis  that lies to the left of the origin and the part of the vertical axis  the   y   axis  below the origin are described by negative numbers  cartesian coordinates are named after the 17th century french philosopher and mathematician renã  descartes  there is a  probably untrue  story that descartes invented these coordinates while lying in bed watching a fly on the ceiling and wondering how to describe its location  descartesâ   penchant for lying in bed until noon may actually have been the cause of his demise  which occurred in stockholm in 1650  descartes was in sweden to act as maths tutor to queen christina  who unfortunately preferred to work early in the morning  according to some reports it was these early hours and the scandinavian temperatures which caused the pneumonia that eventually killed him  others have suggested that he was poisoned by a catholic priest worried about descartesâ   radical theology  either way  the cartesian coordinate system is one of descartesâ   most important legacies  although he was not the only person to have the idea   it allows us to answer geometric problems using algebra and to visualise algebraic relationships that would otherwise remain quite abstract  take for example the equation   y   2x 1    we can plot the graph of this function in a cartesian coordinate system by plotting all points whose coordinates are of the form    x 2x 1     points such as    0   1        1  1        2 3         1  3         2  5          frac 1  2    2     and    1 73  2 46     in this case the graph is a straight line that meets the   y   axis at the point    0  1    and has a slope of   2     figure 4  more generally every straight line is given by an equation of the form   y mx b    where   m   gives you the slope of the line and    0 b    is the point at which it crosses the   y   axis  a vertical line which doesnâ  t cross the   y   axis is given by an equation of the form   x c    in this case    c 0    is the point at which it crosses the   x   axis  what about a circle  a circle consists of all those points that lie at equal distance   r   from a given point   m    letâ  s suppose that   m   is the point    0 0     from pythagorasâ  s theorem we know that if a point    x  y    lies at distance   r   from    0 0     then   x 2 y 2 r 2     figure 5  this therefore is the equation of a circle of radius   r   centred on the origin  you can work out for yourself that a circle of radius   r   centred on the point    a b    has the equation    x a  2    y b  2   r 2    but here is a more complicated question  what shape do you get when you consider all points that lie at equal distance from a given point and a given line  without a coordinate system  you might draw the point and the line and experiment with your ruler or compasses  you could draw a few points that lie at an equal distance from both and see if you can guess the overall shape  armed with a coordinate system  though  the answer becomes a lot easier and much more precise  suppose that the given point is at distance   1   from the given line  letâ  s place the given point at the origin and the given line so that it is horizontal  given by the equation   y  1    by pythagorasâ   theorem the distance of any point    x y    from    0 0    is    sqrt x 2   y 2     the distance from a point    x y    to the line   y    1   is    y 1     we use the modulus here because the   y   coordinate might be negative   if those two are equal  then    y 1     sqrt x 2   y 2     squaring both sides gives   y 2   2y  1   x 2   y 2   rearranging gives   y    frac x 2  2     frac 1  2     so any point at equal distance from the point    0 0    and the line   y  1   has coordinates    left x   frac x 2  2     frac 1  2  right     you can check for yourself that the converse is also true  every point with these coordinates lies at equal distance from the the point    0 0    and the line   y  1     figure 6  we can plot the graph of this function to see the required shape  which turns out to be a parabola  in fact  every quadratic function   y   ax 2   bx   c   for   a      b   and   c   constants  gives us a parabola  this familiar shape  which can come in so many subtle variationsâ  long and thin or squat and flatâ

give any other ways to describe a unique straight line    do any of them represent the same line    now look just at the versions that do describe a unique straight line    pick two of the descriptions  can you take a line given by one description and express it using the other    why might one description be more useful than another  can you identify any advantages or disadvantages of any of these representations        there are many ways of tackling this problem  here is just one of those ways  we recall that   y mx c   describes a unique straight line  therefore  any equation involving   x   and   y   which can be rearranged into that form describes a straight line    the equation   4x 2y 6   can be rearranged to give   y 2x 3    so it describes a unique straight line    we note that   y 2   is of the form   y mx c   with   m 0   and   c 2    so it also describes a straight line    the idea is that for any two  distinct  points there is always a unique straight line going through both points  can you see why    the straight line going through the two points    1 2    and    0  1    must have   m    frac 2   1   1 0  3    by substituting   x 0   and   y  1   into   y 3x c   we obtain   c  1    hence  the unique straight line passing through    1 2    and    0  1    has equation   y 3x 1      the equation   y 4x   is of the above form and so describes a straight line    this also describes a straight line and in fact  we obtain the same straight line as in part a because both lines are described by the same equation    an alternative way to describe a straight line is using vectors  by specifying a fixed point and a direction vector we are uniquely describing the straight line that passes through the given fixed point in the direction of the vector    the equation of the straight line described by the point and the direction vector given must have   m 2 1 2   and   c  3     the latter can be obtained by substituting   x y 3   into   y 2x c     note that   y 2x 3   is the same equation as in parts a and e    the original equation can be rearranged to give   y  frac 1  7 x    so this also describes a straight line  passing through the origin     from part c  recall that for any two distinct points there is a unique straight line passing through both points  therefore  three points describe a straight line only if the third point lies on the straight line passing through the first two points  the equation of the straight line through     1  4    and    3 7    is   y  frac 11  4 x    frac 5  4     however    x y 8   does not satisfy this equation  thus  the three points do not lie on the same straight line  in fact  the three points given describe three different straight lines  the one through     1  4    and    3 7     the one through     1  4    and    8 8     and the one through    3 7    and    8 8       this can be rearranged to give   y 3x 16   and so it also describes a straight line    we repeat what we did in part h and this time all three points lie on the straight line with equation   y 2x 3      you might argue that   y x 2 2   is the equation of a parabola and so it cannot describe a straight line  but are you really convinced by this  below  we make this idea into a rigorous argument    the parabola described by   y x 2 2   passes through the points     1 3        0 2    and    1 3     however  whereas the first and third points lie on the straight line with equation   y 3   the second one does not  so  the equation   y x 2 2   cannot describe a straight line    the equation   y 2 x 2   can be rearranged to give    x y  x y    0    so it describes the two straight lines   y x   and   y  x      rearranging the given equation yields   y  frac 1  14 x  frac 2  7     so it describes a straight line    the approach is similar to what we did in part k  it is possible to find three points that satisfy   xy   1   but do not lie on the same straight line  for example     1 1        left 2  frac 1  2  right        left  frac 1  2  2 right      showing that   xy   1   is not a straight line    we note that   y 2 4xy 4x 2  y 2x  2    so the equation given does indeed describe a straight lineâ  the straight line with equation   y 2x        in question 1  we encountered three different descriptions of a straight line    for any real values   m   and   c   the equation   y mx c   describes a straight line  more generally  the equation of any straight line in the   x     y   plane can be rearranged into the form   ax by c    the advantage of the latter form is that it includes straight lines which are parallel to the   y   axis  e g    x 4      a straight line can be described uniquely by specifying two distinct points through which the line passes    alternatively  it also suffices to specify one point and a direction vector to describe a unique straight line such as in part 1f    of course  there are other ways to describe a unique straight line  for instance  instead of finding the unique straight line passing through two given points  we could instead consider the set of points equidistant to these two points  it turns out that this is again a straight line    in question 1  we rearranged all the equations that described a straight line into the form   y mx c    this now makes it a lot easier to decide which equations describe the same straight line  going back to our results from question 1  we see that parts a  e  f and j all describe the same straight line  we note that these four parts correspond to four different descriptions of the same straight line    letâ  s consider the first two descriptions mentioned in the solution to question 2  if we are given the equation   ax by c   of a straight line then we can easily find two distinct points which lie on this line  just pick two distinct values for   x   and compute the corresponding   y   values  conversely  if we are given two arbitrary points    x_1 y_1    and    x_2 y_2    then we can obtain the equation of the straight line going through both points in the following way  if we have   x_1 x_2   then the straight line is described by the equation   x x_1    otherwise  the gradient of the straight line through both points must be   m  y_2 y_1   x_2 x_1    and the value of   c   can be computed by substituting   x x_1   and   y y_1   into   y mx c      which of the above descriptions is more useful than another always depends on the context you are working in  for instance  as remarked earlier  one disadvantage of the description   y mx c   is that it does not include straight lines parallel to the   y   axis  on the other hand  contrary to the description by the equation   ax by c   or by just specifying two points  you can easily read off the gradient and the   y   intercept of the corresponding straight line from   y mx c           printables  problem solution  relevance  e2 how is the solution of equations related to problems in geometry  g2 what is the

 x 2     0 5x   7y   2   0     xy   1     y 2   4xy   4x 2   0    how did you decide    can you give any other ways to describe a unique straight line    do any of them represent the same line    now look just at the versions that do describe a unique straight line    pick two of the descriptions  can you take a line given by one description and express it using the other    why might one description be more useful than another  can you identify any advantages or disadvantages of any of these representations        there are many ways of tackling this problem  here is just one of those ways  we recall that   y mx c   describes a unique straight line  therefore  any equation involving   x   and   y   which can be rearranged into that form describes a straight line    the equation   4x 2y 6   can be rearranged to give   y 2x 3    so it describes a unique straight line    we note that   y 2   is of the form   y mx c   with   m 0   and   c 2    so it also describes a straight line    the idea is that for any two  distinct  points there is always a unique straight line going through both points  can you see why  the straight line going through the two points    1 2    and    0  1    must have   m    frac 2   1   1 0  3    by substituting   x 0   and   y  1   into   y 3x c   we obtain   c  1    hence  the unique straight line passing through    1 2    and    0  1    has equation   y 3x 1      the equation   y 4x   is of the above form and so describes a straight line    this also describes a straight line and in fact  we obtain the same straight line as in part a because both lines are described by the same equation    an alternative way to describe a straight line is using vectors  by specifying a fixed point and a direction vector we are uniquely describing the straight line that passes through the given fixed point in the direction of the vector  the equation of the straight line described by the point and the direction vector given must have   m 2 1 2   and   c  3     the latter can be obtained by substituting   x y 3   into   y 2x c     note that   y 2x 3   is the same equation as in parts a and e    the original equation can be rearranged to give   y  frac 1  7 x    so this also describes a straight line  passing through the origin     from part c  recall that for any two distinct points there is a unique straight line passing through both points  therefore  three points describe a straight line only if the third point lies on the straight line passing through the first two points  the equation of the straight line through     1  4    and    3 7    is   y  frac 11  4 x    frac 5  4     however    x y 8   does not satisfy this equation  thus  the three points do not lie on the same straight line  in fact  the three points given describe three different straight lines  the one through     1  4    and    3 7     the one through     1  4    and    8 8     and the one through    3 7    and    8 8       this can be rearranged to give   y 3x 16   and so it also describes a straight line    we repeat what we did in part h and this time all three points lie on the straight line with equation   y 2x 3      you might argue that   y x 2 2   is the equation of a parabola and so it cannot describe a straight line  but are you really convinced by this  below  we make this idea into a rigorous argument  the parabola described by   y x 2 2   passes through the points     1 3        0 2    and    1 3     however  whereas the first and third points lie on the straight line with equation   y 3   the second one does not  so  the equation   y x 2 2   cannot describe a straight line    the equation   y 2 x 2   can be rearranged to give    x y  x y    0    so it describes the two straight lines   y x   and   y  x      rearranging the given equation yields   y  frac 1  14 x  frac 2  7     so it describes a straight line    the approach is similar to what we did in part k  it is possible to find three points that satisfy   xy   1   but do not lie on the same straight line  for example     1 1        left 2  frac 1  2  right        left  frac 1  2  2 right      showing that   xy   1   is not a straight line    we note that   y 2 4xy 4x 2  y 2x  2    so the equation given does indeed describe a straight lineâ  the straight line with equation   y 2x        in question 1  we encountered three different descriptions of a straight line    for any real values   m   and   c   the equation   y mx c   describes a straight line  more generally  the equation of any straight line in the   x     y   plane can be rearranged into the form   ax by c    the advantage of the latter form is that it includes straight lines which are parallel to the   y   axis  e g    x 4      a straight line can be described uniquely by specifying two distinct points through which the line passes    alternatively  it also suffices to specify one point and a direction vector to describe a unique straight line such as in part 1f    of course  there are other ways to describe a unique straight line  for instance  instead of finding the unique straight line passing through two given points  we could instead consider the set of points equidistant to these two points  it turns out that this is again a straight line    in question 1  we rearranged all the equations that described a straight line into the form   y mx c    this now makes it a lot easier to decide which equations describe the same straight line  going back to our results from question 1  we see that parts a  e  f and j all describe the same straight line  we note that these four parts correspond to four different descriptions of the same straight line    letâ  s consider the first two descriptions mentioned in the solution to question 2  if we are given the equation   ax by c   of a straight line then we can easily find two distinct points which lie on this line  just pick two distinct values for   x   and compute the corresponding   y   values  conversely  if we are given two arbitrary points    x_1 y_1    and    x_2 y_2    then we can obtain the equation of the straight line going through both points in the following way  if we have   x_1 x_2   then the straight line is described by the equation   x x_1    otherwise  the gradient of the straight line through both points must be   m  y_2 y_1   x_2 x_1    and the value of   c   can be computed by substituting   x x_1   and   y y_1   into   y mx c      which of the above descriptions is more useful than another always depends on the context you are working in  for instance  as remarked earlier  one disadvantage of the description   y mx c   is that it does not include straight lines parallel to the   y   axis  on the other hand  contrary to the description by the equation   ax by c   or by just specifying two points  you can easily read off the gradient and the   y   intercept of the corresponding straight line from   y mx c           printables  problem solution

drawing some of them on a computer  you could use a graph drawing programme you are familiar with or use the desmos online graphing software    do any of the descriptions in question 1 represent the same straight line    what ways of describing straight lines have been used in question  160 1  can you give any other ways to describe a unique straight line    now consider the equation   y 4x 1    which describes a straight line  use some of the ways of describing straight lines you have identified to give alternative descriptions of this straight line    why might one description be more useful than another  can you identify any advantages or disadvantages of any of these representations        which of the following describe or determine a single straight line  there are many ways of tackling this problem  here is just one of those ways  we recall that the equation of a straight line can  usually  be written as   y mx c    where   m    160 is the gradient and   c    160 is the   y   intercept  therefore  any equation involving   x   and  160   y   which can be rearranged into that form describes a straight line      4x   2y   6   the equation   4x 2y 6   can be rearranged to give   y 2x 3    so it describes a unique straight line      y   2   we note that   y 2   is of the form   y mx c   with   m 0   and   c 2    so it also describes a straight line    the points    1 2    and    0  1    the idea here is that for any two  distinct  points there is always a unique straight line going through both points  can you see why this should be the case  the straight line going through the two points    1 2    and    0  1    must have gradient   m    frac 2   1   1 0  3    by substituting   x 0   and   y  1   into   y 3x c   we obtain   c  1    hence  the unique straight line passing through    1 2    and    0  1    has equation   y 3x 1    you might also have spotted a quicker way in this case  since the line passes through    0  1     this tells us that the   y   intercept is    1    so   c  1    an alternative way to find the equation is to substitute the coordinates of both pairs of points into the equation   y mx c   to get a pair of simultaneous equations     begin aligned  2  amp   m times 1   c    1  amp   m times 0   c  end aligned    these simplify to give    begin aligned  2  amp   m   c    1  amp   c  end aligned    so   c  1   and   m 3    giving   y 3x 1   as before      y    frac 3  2 x   the equation   y  frac 3  2 x   is of the form   y mx c   with   c 0   and so describes a straight line which passes through the origin    the points     1   4        3  7     and    8  8    from part c  recall that for any two distinct points there is a unique straight line passing through both points  therefore  three points will describe a straight line only if the third point lies on the straight line passing through the first two points  the equation of the straight line through     1  4    and    3 7    is   y  frac 11  4 x    frac 5  4     however    x y 8   does not satisfy this equation  thus  the three points do not lie on the same straight line  in fact  the three points given describe three different straight lines  the one through     1  4    and    3 7     the one through     1  4    and    8 8     and the one through    3 7    and    8 8     another way of working out that these three points do not lie on the same straight line is to work out the gradient of the lines between two pairs  if they are equal  then we have a straight line  but if not  we do not  in this case  the gradient of the line between     1  4    and    3 7    is    frac 11  4     whereas that between    3 7    and    8 8    is    frac 1  5     which is clearly different      y   3   2x   this also describes a straight line as it is in the form   y mx c   with   m  2   and   c 3      the point    0  1    and the constant gradient   3   a straight line has a constant gradient  in this case it is  160   3    and the intersection with the   y   axis is at    1    so this describes the straight line   y 3x 1        x  2   this is a vertical straight line through the point     2 0     parallel to the   y   axis  this type of straight line is the only one which cannot be written in the form   y mx c        y   x 2   2   you might argue that   y x 2 2   is the equation of a parabola and so it cannot describe a straight line  but are you really convinced by this  or could you really convince someone who is sceptical  weâ  ll give an argument that proves it cannot be a straight line  the parabola described by   y x 2 2   passes through the points     1 3        0 2    and    1 3     however  whereas the first and third points lie on the straight line with equation   y 3   the second one does not  so  the equation   y x 2 2   cannot describe a straight line      x   7y   5   this can be rearranged to give   y  frac 1  7 x    frac 5  7     so it describes a straight line      y   8   3 x   3    this can be rearranged to give   y 3x   1   and so it also describes a straight line    the points    left  frac 1  2  2 right        1 1     and    left  frac 3  2   0 right    we repeat what we did in part e  but this time all three points lie on the straight line with equation   y 3   2x         y 2   x 2   lt  div gt   the obvious thing to do is to take the square root of both sides  to get the equation   y x    so this describes a straight line  or does it  answer   when we take square roots of equations  we must always remember that there are two possible square roots  a positive one and a negative one  so actually  we can take square roots to get   y  pm x    so there are actually two straight lines here    y x   and   y  x    another way to go about doing this is to rewrite the original equation as   y 2 x 2 0    the left hand side is a difference of two squares  so we can factorise it to get    y x  y x  0    so either   y x 0   or   y x 0    which are the two straight lines   y  x   and   y x    if this seems strange  remember that the graph of an equation is all those points whose coordinates satisfy the equation  in this case  points such as    1 1        1  1         1 1    and     1  1    all work in the equation   y 2 x 2    so we get both lines      the point    3 3    and the direction specified by the vector    binom 1  2    an alternative way to describe a straight line is using vectors  by specifying a fixed point and a direction vector we are uniquely describing the straight line that passes through the given fixed point in the direction of the vector  the vector given says â  go   1   in the   x   direction and   2   in the   y   direction  so the gradient must be   m 2 1 2    then the equation of the straight line described by the point and the direction vector given must be   y 2x c    substituting   x y 3   into this then gives   c 3    so   y 2x 3         frac 1  3 y   x    frac 1  3    0   this can be rearranged to give   y 3x 1    to this is a straight line      xy   1   we can rearrange this to get   y  frac 1  x     you may recall the shape of this graph  if not  you should have a go at drawing it  to prove that it is not a straight line  we can use the same approach as in part  160 i  we pick three points that satisfy   xy   1   and discover that they do not lie on the same straight line  for example     1 1        left 2  frac 1  2  right        left  frac 1  2  2 right      showing that   xy   1   is not a straight line       y 2   4xy   4x 2   0   lt  div gt   this is tricky  we have a quadratic equal to zero  so what might be a sensible thing to do to it  answer  we can attempt to factorise the quadratic  in this case  we can do so  with some thinking  to get   y 2 4xy 4x 2  y 2x  2    so the equation given becomes    y 2x  2 0    so we must have   y 2x 0    and so we do indeed have a straight lineâ  the straight line with equation   y 2x          do any of the descriptions in question 1 represent the same straight line  in question 1  we rearranged all the equations that described a straight line into the form   y mx c    this now makes it a lot easier to decide which equations describe the same straight line  going back to our results from question 1  we see that parts a and n both describe   y 2x 3    parts c  g  k and o describe   y 3x 1   and parts f and l describe   y 3 2x    in each case  the different parts offer different descriptions of the same straight line    what ways of describing straight lines have been used in question  160 1  can you give any other ways to describe a unique straight line  in question 1  we encountered several different descriptions of a straight line    the equation   y mx c   describes a straight line for any numbers   m   and   c    this equation can also be rearranged in lots of ways    the equation   x c   describes a vertical straight line for any real number   c    putting these two together  it turns out that we can rearrange the equation of any straight line in the   x     y   plane into the form   ax by c   for some numbers   a      b   and   c    including those which are vertical and horizontal    a straight line can be described uniquely by specifying two distinct points through which the line passes    a straight line can be specified by giving its gradient and one point through which it passes    alternatively  one point and a direction vector also describes a straight line as in part 1n    there are other ways to describe a unique straight line  for instance  we could consider the locus of all points equidistant from two given points  you may recall that this also gives a straight line  are there still further ways    now consider the equation   y 4x 1    which describes a straight line  use some of the ways of describing straight lines you have identified to give alternative descriptions of this straight line  we can easily rearrange this into the form   ax by c    we get   4x y  1    we can also easily find two points on the line  just pick two distinct values for   x   and compute the corresponding   y   values  for example    0 1    and    1 5     following question 1g  we can describe the line by giving its gradient  which is   4    and some point it passes through  for example    2 9     to give the vector formulation  we can turn the gradient   4   into the vector    binom 1  4     why    160 and then give a point on the line such as     1  3     it is somewhat harder to describe this line as the locus of points equidistant from two specified points  and it will take some thinking about  weâ  ll leave this as a challenge    why might one description be more useful than another  can you identify any advantages or disadvantages of any of these representations  whether one of the above descriptions is more useful than another always depends on the context you are working in  for instance  as remarked earlier  one disadvantage of the description   y mx c   is that it does not include straight lines parallel to the   y   axis  on the other hand  contrary to the description by the equation   ax by c   or by just specifying two points  you can easily read off the gradient and

these to get some simultaneous equationsâ    approach b  the centre of the circle must be the same distance from all the points  so it must lie on the perpendicular bisector of each line segment joining two points  so we could find some perpendicular bisectors and find where they intersectâ    approach c  if we have two non parallel chords in a circle  then their perpendicular bisectors intersect at the centre of the circle  perhaps we can use thatâ    approach d  we know that the centre  say    a b     is at an equal distance from all points  so we could write down the distances from    a b    to our known points  and then equate thoseâ      if we pick two  distinct  points  then there are many circles that pass through both points  can you say anything about the centres of these circles  if we pick three  distinct  points  then the number of possibilities seems to shrink dramatically  what can you say about where the centre of the circle must be  is there always a

acute triangles  all angles are less than   90   degrees   but all triangles have one thing in common  apart from having three sides   they are stable  the best way to understand this is to think of a different shape  for example a square  if you make a square from four metal rods with hinges at their corners  you will find that it doesnâ  t stay square  it can easily be transformed into a parallelogram  you donâ  t have to bend the sides to do that  it happens just because of the hinges at the corners     figure1  fig1 png   image made by mf we need to do some tidying up with images

is a little more permissive  suppose you form a polyhedron by hinging together rigid faces at their edges  in the 19th century the french mathematician augustin louis cauchy showed that all convex polyhedra are rigid  convex means that any line connecting two points that are part of the polyhedron is also contained in the polyhedron  this means that the five familiar platonic solids are rigid  i think that we might need to explain what platonic solids are  perhaps with the help of pictures  â  vicky  the icosahedron on the left is a convex polyhedron with twenty faces  the small stellated dodecahedron on the right is not convex because some of its faces point inwards  both polyhedra are rigid  the image on the right was created with robert webbâ  s great stella software  images from plus   what about non convex ones  like the small stellated dodecahedron  it turns out that this one is rigid  but for a very long time nobody was able to prove whether thatâ  s true for all of them

   pi   even comes up in the bible  implicitly  in a passage of 1 kings 7 which sees huram of tyre build a circular â  sea of cast metalâ   for king solomon  it measured   30   cubits in circumference and   10   in diameter  giving the crude approximation of   30 10  3    the first person to approach the problem of estimating    pi   systematically seems to have been archimedes working in the third century bc  he fitted a regular polygon with   96   sides inside a circle  so that its vertices were sitting on the circle  then he drew a polygon with the same number of sides around the circle  so that the centres of its sides just touched the circle  could re draw this image and include with an appropriate caption  theyâ  re not 96 sides but people will get the drift  http   en wikipedia org

of these two numbers    22 7    might be familiarâ  even today some people think that    pi   is exactly equal to it  itâ  s an assertion that makes most mathematicians scream  writing    pi   as a bog standard fraction is denying its irrationality and thereby much of its mystery  archimedes was out performed  at least in calculational stamina  by the chinese mathematician and astronomer zu chongzhi who in the fifth century ad worked out that   3 1415926  lt   pi  lt  3 1415927    zu chongzhiâ  s original writings are lost  but if he used archimedesâ   method then he must have inscribed a regular polygon with   24 576   sides in a circle and made a huge number of calculations to admirable accuracy  archimedesâ   method for approximating    pi   is reassuring  although we can never pin    pi   down exactly  itâ  s possible  at least in theory  to calculate it to any degree of accuracy by increasing the number of sides of the polygon you inscribe in a circle  but zu chongzhiâ  s effort also illustrates a limitation of this approach  you might have to make an enormous number of calculations to get get a result thatâ  s only accurate to a few decimal places  modern approaches to estimating    pi   use methods that are surprisingly un geometrical  in the 16th and 17th centuries  in the age of calculus with its penchant for infinity  mathematicians came up with a number of expressions for    pi   using infinite sums and products  perhaps the most beautiful result carries the names of gottfried leibniz  one of the inventors of calculus  and the scottish mathematician james gregory  although it had been discovered two centuries earlier by the indian mathematician madhava of sangamagramma  it says that if we start with   1    subtract   1 3    then add   1 5    subtract   1 7    add   1 9    and keep going like this forever  the sequence of numbers we get converges to    pi 4    that is     pi 4   is the result of the infinite sum    pi 4   1   1 3   1 5   1 7    ldots   itâ  s an amazing result  linking geometry on the left hand side of the equation to arithmetic on the right  but it is still useless when it comes to approximating    pi    if you add subtract the first hundred terms in the madhava leibniz gregory sum and multiply by   4    the number you get is only accurate to only two decimal places  in the early twentieth century  however  two russian brothers  david and gregory chudnowski  came up with a complicated infinite expression for    pi   that converges quite fast  in 2011 shigeru kondo  a japanese systems engineer  and alexander yee  a 23 year old graduate student who by his own admission â  suckedâ   at school maths  used that formula to give the best estimate of    pi   to date  it was computed on kondoâ  s home computer and gives    pi   to over ten trillion digits  the ten trillionth digit is   5    incidentally  there are also people who prefer to memorise the digits of    pi   without the aid of a computer  a

brother to the shores of north africa  she begged the local leader hiarbas to be given as much land as could be enclosed by a single ox hide  â  iâ  m sure we can spare that much â   hiarbas must have thought  and he granted her wish  dido proceeded to cut the ox hide into thin strips  attached them at their ends and  presumably to hiarbasâ   surprise  enclosed an area large enough to start a kingdom  all this is legend  but the mathematical problem is real  how should you arrange a long strip to enclose as large an area as possible  the answer is simple  in a circle  to get some intuition as to why that is  think of a square  we can increase the area it covers by bulging out the sides  if we bulge them out as regularly as possible  smoothing out the corners  we get a circle  we can increase the area of any other shape using this â  bulging outâ   technique  and in the end we always end up with a circle  the answer is intuitively clear  so itâ  s surprising how long it took mathematicians to prove that the circle really is the shape that encloses a maximal area for a given perimeter  during the 18th century they attacked the problem using the calculus of variations  which is all about finding the â  bestâ   solution to a problem  dido was thinking about all possible curves that enclose an area  the best one being the one that encloses the largest area  but you could also consider a collection of paths connecting two points and ask which one is shortest  or takes the least effort to traverse  and so on  integration plays an important part in solving these problems  as we need to sum the values of a given quantity for each of the infinitely many points along a curve  interestingly  we can derive some of the laws of nature using such variational principles  for example  newtonâ  s laws of motion can be derived if we assume that a particle moving from   a   to   b   always takes the path that minimises something called the action  this is a measure of the effort involved in traversing the path  the laws of reflection and refraction for rays of light can be derived if we assume that light always takes the path that takes the least time to traverse  facts like these have led to the idea that â  nature is frugalâ  â  it always seeks to minimise certain quantities  didoâ  s problem  however  was not entirely solved until the 19th century

guide         the bigger picture squaring the circle    one of the greatest mathematical problems of antiquity was to square the circle  using only a straightedge  a ruler without markings  and compasses  the task was to construct a square with the same area as a given circleâ  in a finite number of steps  of course  many great mathematicians tried their minds at this  to no avail  since 1882 we know that it is in fact impossible  the german mathematician ferdinand von lindemann proved that    pi   can never be the solution of a straightforward equation  this is in stark contrast to some other familiar irrational numbers  for example    sqrt 2     which is a solution of the short equation   x 2   2    the number    pi    on the other hand  is transcendental  it cannot be the solution of a polynomial with rational coefficients  itâ  s a property that    pi   shares with the number   e   and itâ  s the reason why we canâ  t square the circle  any geometric attempt to do this using a straightedge and compasses would translate into    pi   being a solution of a polynomial equation  despite the incontrovertible proof of    pi  â  s transcendentality  there are people who havenâ  t given up  itâ  s no rarity for an eminent mathematician to receive enthusiastic emails or letters containing purported circle squaring methods  the stubbornness of two of such enthusiasts was illustrated beautifully by the logician charles dodgson  more famous as lewis carroll  author of alice in wonderland  in 1890  dodgson wrote in the introduction to his book a new theory of parallels   the first of these two misguided visionaries filled me with a great ambition to do a feat i have never heard of as accomplished by man  namely to convince a circle squarer of his error  the value my friend selected for pi was 3 2  the enormous error tempted me with the idea that it could be easily demonstrated to be an error  more than a score of letters were interchanged before i became sadly convinced that i had no chance   a few years after dodgsonâ  s writing another hobby mathematician  edwin j  goodwin from indiana  usa  also believed that he had found a method for squaring the circle which involved setting    pi   equal to   3 2    he copyrighted his idea  but offered the indiana government the opportunity to use the new â  mathematical truthâ   in schools free of charge  a bill to that effect was submitted to the general assembly in 1897  perhaps the only attempt ever made  at least in the modern era  to legislate mathematicsâ  it took quite a lot of

as circles can intersect in at most two points  we will need at most three satellites to work out your exact location    this method for finding a targetâ  s location is called trilateration  now letâ  s explore another method  multireceiver radar  which uses another conic section but requires fewer transmissions  suppose again that you are lost in the jungle but that this time you have no map  my friend anna and i need to pin point your location to come and rescue you  i send you a signal  you immediately reply and anna picks up the reply  anna and i can communicate to establish the time that passed between me sending the signal and anna receiving your reply   what distance can anna and i work out using that information  answer  writing   x   for the distance between me and you and   y   for the distance between you and anna  we can work out   x y   by multiplying the total time elapsed between me sending the signal and anna receiving your reply by the signalâ  s speed     which conic section describes all your possible locations  answer  an ellipse with foci at my and annaâ  s locations     how many more people are needed to pin point your exact location  how many transmissions are needed  answer  as with circles  ellipses generally meet in two points  so we would need two more ellipses  that is  two more people  only two transmissions are needed  mine and yours    one downside of this method is that it assumes the target will immediately reply to any signal we send  what if we canâ  t guarantee they will respond  perhaps they donâ  t want to be found  another conic section provides the answer  suppose now that you are hiding out in the jungle and that you are transmitting signals to your conspirators elsewhere  so as to not give away your location too easily your signals do not include information as to when they were sent  anna and i can both pick up a signal sent by you and communicate to each other the time at which we received it  this means that we can work out the difference between the time it took the signal to reach me and the time it took to reach anna   what distance can anna and i work out using that information  answer  writing   x   for the distance between me and you and   y   for the distance between you and anna  we can work out    x y    by multiplying the difference between the time it took the signal to reach me and the time it took to reach anna by the speed of the signal     which conic section describes all your possible locations  answer  a hyperbola with foci at my and annaâ  s locations     how many more people would anna and i need to pin point your exact location  answer  as for circles and ellipses  hyperbolae generally meet in two points  so we would need two more hyperbolae  that is  two more people    this

means that    l   k a   is divisible by   b    however    l   k   is an integer value somewhere between   1   and   b   2    we already know that   ab   is the smallest multiple of   a   that is

n 2 1     amp  n n 1  n 1  n 2 1    end aligned    this expression is divisible by   2    thatâ  s because   n   and   n 1   are two consecutive integers  so one of them must be even and the other odd  then  as   n 5 n   is divisible by both   n   and   n 1    it has at least one even factor and must therefore be even  the product of an even integer and any other integer is always even   this expression is also divisible by   3    thatâ  s because   n 1      n   and   n 1   are three consecutive integers  so one of them must be a multiple of   3    we can see this by considering the remainder left upon dividing   n   by   3    the only possible values are   0      1    and   2    if it is   0    then   n   is a multiple of   3    if it is   3    then   n 1   is a multiple of   3    if it is   2    then   n 1   is a multiple of   3    similarly to above  since   n 5 n   is divisible by   n 1      n    and   n 1    it must have a factor which is a multiple of   3    and therefore must itself be divisible by   3    this expression is also divisible by   5    although this is slightly tricker to show than in the previous two parts  firstly  we consider the remainder left when we divide   n   by   5    this can take the values   0      1      2      3    and   4    weâ  ll consider the five cases separately   case 1 if this remainder is   0    then   n   itself is divisible by   5    and then so is   n 5 n    since it is divisible by   n    case 2 if this remainder is   1    then   n 1   is divisible by   5    and then so is   n 5 n    as it is divisible by   n 1    case 3 if this remainder is   2    then   n   is   2   greater than a multiple of   5    that is  we can write   n 5k 2   for some integer   k    then    begin aligned  n 2 1 amp   5k 2  2 1

it is divisible by   n 2 1    case 4 similarly  if this remainder is   3    then we can write   n 5m 3    for some integer   m    then    begin aligned  n 2 1 amp   5m 3  2 1    amp  25m 2 30m 10   amp  5 5m 2 6m 2    end aligned    so again    n 2 1   is a multiple of   5    meaning that   n 5 n   is too  case 5 if the remainder is   4    then   n 1   is divisible by   5    and then so is   n 5 n    as it is divisible by   n 1     we have shown that  for all   n      n 5 n   is divisible by   2      3    and   5    this means that every term in the sequence is divisible by the lowest common multiple of   2      3   and   5    in this case this is simply their product    30    as they have no common prime factors  so   30   divides every number in the sequence  this means that the largest

factors comes from the observation that any factor of   100   must be of the form   2 a 5 b    where   a   is 0  1 or 2 and   b   is 0  1 or 2         q19 solution    four positive integers   a      b      c   and   d   are such that   abcd abc bcd cda dab ab bc cd da ac bd a b c d 2009    what is the value of   a b c d      we can simplify the left hand side of the equation to be    a 1  b 1  c 1  d 1  1    hence     a 1  b 1  c 1  d 1  2010    now  expressing   2010   as a product of primes gives   2010 2 times3 times5 times67    as it has only four prime factors  these must be   a 1      b 1      c 1    and   d 1   in some order  this means that   a      b      c    and   d   must be   1      2      4    and   66   in some order  thus   a b c d 1 2 4 66 73          q20 solution    the primorial of a number is the product of all the prime numbers less than or equal to that number  for example  the primorial of   6   is   2 times3 times5 30    how many different whole numbers have a primorial of   210      from the question  we know that the primorial of   6   is less than   210    so no number less than   6   will have a primorial of   210    the primorial of   7   is   2 times3 times5 times7 210    as   8     9   and   10   are not prime numbers  they too have a primorial of   210    any number greater than or equal to   11   will have a primorial of at least   2 times3 times5 times7 times11 2310    so  there are exactly   4   integers with a primorial of   210          q21 solution    show that  if   n   is an integer such that    n 3  3 n 3  n 3  3  qquad qquad  ast    then   n   is even and   n 2   is a factor of   54    deduce that there is no integer   n   which satisfies the equation     ast     show that  if   n   is an integer such that    n 6  3 n 3  n 6  3  qquad qquad  ast ast    then   n   is even  deduce that there is no integer   n   which satisfies the equation     ast ast       expand the brackets to obtain    n 3  3 n 3 9n 2 27n 27    and    n 3  3 n 3 9n 2 27n 27    then the equation simplifies to   n 3 18n 2 54 0    which can be rearranged to   n 2 n 18  54    if   n   is odd then   n 2   and   n 18   are odd  and so their product is odd  but this is a contradiction because we know that   n 2 n 18  54    therefore   n   is even  alternatively we could argue as follows  if   n   is odd then   n 3   and   n 3   are both even  then   n 3   is odd and    n 3  3   and    n 3  3   are both even  but then the left hand side of    n 3  3 n 3  n 3  3   is odd whilst the right hand side is even  which is a contradiction  therefore   n   must be even  from the rearrangement   n 2 n 18  54   we can see immediately  because   n   is an integer  that   n 2   is a factor of   54    if there is an integer   n   which satisfies the equation then we know it must be even and   n 2   must be a factor of   54    the prime factorisation of   54   is   54 2 times3 3   and so the only square factor of   54   is   3 2    but   3   is not even  so there is no such   n    alternatively we could argue that because   n 2   is always non negative for integer values of   n   and   n 2 n 18  54   we must have   n 18  gt  0    but   18 2 gt 54   so   n 2   cannot be a factor of   54     we can use a very similar idea for the second part  we have    n 6  3 n 3 18n 2 108n 216    and    n 6  3 n 3 18n 2 108n 216    so the equation simplifies to   n 3 36n 2 432 0    which can be rearranged into   n 2 n 36  432    if   n   is odd then   n 2   and   n 36   are odd  and so their product is odd  but this is a contradiction because we know that   n 2 n 36  432    therefore   n   is even  we can also note that   n 2   is a factor of   432    since   n 2   is always non negative for integer values of   n   we must have   n gt 36    but   36 2 gt 432   so   n 2   cannot be a factor of   432    therefore there is no such   n          q22 solution    find the integer    n    that satisfies   n 2 lt 33127 lt  n 1  2    find also a small integer   m   such that    n m  2 33127   is a perfect square  hence express   33127   in the form   pq    where   p   and   q   are integers greater than   1    by considering the possible factorisations of   33127    show that there are exactly two values of   m   for which    n m  2 33127   is a perfect square  and find the other value    since   182 2 33124   and   183 2 33489    let   n 182    since   184 2 33127 729 27 2    let   m 2    we might notice that we have a difference of two squares  which is often helpful for factorising something  therefore   184 2 27 2 33127    so   33127  184 27  times 184 27     which implies that   33127 157 times211     if    n m  2   33127   is a perfect square  say   k 2   where   k   is an integer  then we have that   33127   is a difference of two squares    33127    n m  2   k 2    n m k  n m k     so   n m k   and   n m k   must be factors of   33127    it is crucial to realise that   157   and   211   are both prime numbers  hence the only other factorisation of   33127   is   33127 1 times33127    in fact    33127   has four other factors  the negatives of the factors that we have found so far  you might like to consider whether they contribute anything helpful  therefore   33127  16564 16563  times 16564 16563  16564 2 16563 2    so   m 16382    the question is based on the method of fermat factorisation  which can sometimes be used effectively to factorise integers  notice how we have factorised a number without ever dividing        q24 solution      suppose that   a      b   and   c   are integers that satisfy the equation   a 3   3b 3   9c 3    explain why   a   must be divisible by   3    and show further that both   b   and   c   must also be divisible by   3    hence show that the only integer solution is   a   b   c   0      suppose that   p      q   and   r   are integers that satisfy the equation   p 4   2q 4   5r 4    by considering the posisble final digit of each term  or otherwise  show that   p   and   q   are divisble by   5    hence show that the only integer solution is   p   q   r   0          we have   a 3   9c 3   3b 3   3 3c 3   b 3     so   a 3   is a multiple of   3    note that if   3   divides a product   rs    then   3   must divide either   r   or   s    as   3   is prime  therefore  since   a 3   a a a    and   3   divides   a 3    it follows that   3   must divide one of the factors  that is    3   must divide   a    now we can write   a   3d    where   d   is an integer  therefore we have    3d  3   3b 3   9c 3    which  on dividing by   3    gives   9d 3   b 3   3c 3    by the same argument  as   b 3   3 c 3   3d 3     it follows that   b 3    and hence also   b    is divisible by   3    we repeat the same trick  writing   b   3e    where   e   is an integer  so that   9d 3    3e  3   3c 3    we again divide by   3   to get   3d 3   9e 3   c 3    so that   c 3    and hence also   c    is divisible by   3    we then write   c   3f    where   f   is an integer  giving   3d 3   9e 3    3f  3    finally  we divide this equation by   3   to get   d 3   3e 3   9f 3    note that this is the same equation that we started with  so if   a      b      c   are integers which satisfy the equation  then so are   d    frac a  3       e    frac b  3    and   f    frac c  3     we can repeat this process indefinitely  so that    frac a  3 n        frac b  3 n    and    frac c  3 n    are also integers which satisfy the equation  but if    frac a  3 n    is an integer for all   n  ge 0    we must have   a   0    and similarly for   b   and   c    therefore the only integer solution is   a   b   c   0      we are interested in the equation   p 4   2q 4   5r 4    we consider the final digit of fourth powers     â    â  â   â  â       a      a 4     2a 4                           0      0      0      â    â  â   â  â       1      1      2      â    â  â   â  â       2      6      2      â    â  â   â  â       3      1      2      â    â  â   â  â       4      6      2      â    â  â   â  â       5      5      0      â    â  â   â  â       6      6      2      â    â  â   â  â       7      1      2      â    â  â   â  â       8      6      2      â    â  â   â  â       9      1      2      â    â  â   â  â    so the last digits of fourth powers are all either   0      1      5   or   6    and the last digits of twice fourth powers are all either   0   or   2    also    5r 4   is a multiple of   5    so it must end in a   0   or a   5    therefore  if   2q 4   ends in   0    which happens exactly when   q   is a multiple of   5     the possibilities for the final digit of   p 4   2q 4   are    0   or   1   or   5   or   6       0   0   or   1   or   5   or   6    so it can equal   5r 4    which ends in   0   or   5    only if   p 4   ends in   0   or   5    which is exactly when   p   is a multiple of   5    similarly  if   2q 4   ends in   2    so   q   is not a multiple of   5     the possibilities for the final digit of   p 4   2q 4   are    0   or   1   or   5   or   6       2   2   or   3   or   7   or   8    so it can not be equal to   5r 4    which ends in   0   or   5     therefore  if   p 4   2q 4   5r 4    we must have   p   and   q   both being multiples of   5    now as in part  i   we write   p   5a   and   q   5b    where   a   and   b   are both integers  to get    5a  4   2 5b  4   5r 4    dividing both sides by   5   gives   5 3a 4   2 5 3b 4   r 4    where we are using dot to mean multiplication  so as before    r 4   must be a multiple of   5   as the left hand side is   5 5 2a 4   2 5 2b 4     thus  since   5   is prime    r   itself must be divisible by   5    then writing   r   5c   gives   5 3a 4   2 5 3b 4    5c  4    which yields   a 4   2b 4   5c 4   on dividing by   5 3    so once again  if   p      q      r   give an integer solution to the equation  then so do   a    frac p  5       b    frac q  5    and   c    frac r  5     repeating this  so are    frac p  5 n        frac q  5 n        frac r  5 n    for any integer   n  geq 0    and as before  this shows that the only integer solution is   p   q   r   0     again  the same argument as before shows that this is also the only rational solution   the type of argument is sometimes known as infinite descent        q25 solution    a proper factor of an integer   n   is a positive integer  not   1   or   n    that divides   n      show

let   n   be the smallest positive integer that has exactly   426   proper factors  determine   n    giving your answer in terms of its prime factors        any factor of   3 2  times 5 3   must be of the form   3 r  times 5 s   with   0  leq r  leq 2   and   0  leq s  leq 3    this gives   3   possible values for   r   and   4   for   s    so there are   3  times 4   12   factors  but two of these are not proper factors  namely   1   and   3 2  times 5 3   itself   so there are   12   2   10   proper factors  we could list these  if we wanted      3 0  times 5 0    1     this is not a proper factor      3 0  times 5 1    5        3 0  times 5 2    25        3 0  times 5 3    125        3 1  times 5 0    3        3 1  times 5 1    15        3 1  times 5 2    75        3 1  times 5 3    375

to count the factors of   3 2  times 5 3    we can answer the second part  the number of proper factors of   3 a  times 5 b   is    a   1  b   1    2    as the power of   3   in a factor can be   0      1    â    or   a    and the power of   5   can be   0      1    â    or   b    so we require    a   1  b   1    2   10    or    a   1  b   1    12    unfinished so there are   6   possibilities in

it suffices to note that    frac 1  n   1     frac 1  n n 1      frac n 1  n n   1      frac 1  n     in this expression  we can choose   n   to be an arbitrary integer greater than   1    since   n n

product   rs    then   3   must divide either   r   or   s    as   3   is prime  therefore  since   a 3   a a a    and   3   divides   a 3    it follows that   3   must divide one of the factors  that is    3   must divide   a    now we can write   a   3d    where   d   is an integer  therefore we have    3d  3   3b 3   9c 3    which  on dividing by   3    gives   9d 3   b 3   3c 3    by the same argument  as   b 3   3 c 3   3d 3     it follows that   b 3    and hence also   b    is divisible by   3    we repeat the same trick  writing   b   3e    where   e   is an integer  so that   9d 3    3e  3   3c 3    we again divide by   3   to get   3d 3   9e 3   c 3    so that   c 3    and hence also   c    is divisible by   3    we then write   c   3f    where   f   is an integer  giving   3d 3

the equation  then so are   d    frac a  3       e    frac b  3    and   f    frac c  3     we can repeat this process indefinitely  so that for any   n    the numbers    frac a  3 n        frac b  3

therefore the only integer solution is   a   b   c   0      we are interested in the equation   p 4   2q 4   5r 4    we consider the final digit of fourth powers          a     a 4     2a 4         0

the last digits of fourth powers are all either   0      1      5   or   6    and the last digits of twice fourth powers are all either   0   or   2    also    5r 4   is a multiple of   5    so it must end in a   0   or a   5    therefore  if   2q 4   ends in   0    which happens exactly when   q   is a multiple of   5     the possibilities for the final digit of   p 4   2q 4   are    0  mbox  or   1  mbox  or   5  mbox  or   6   0   0  mbox  or   1  mbox  or   5  mbox  or   6    so it can equal   5r 4    which ends in   0   or   5    only if   p 4   ends in   0   or   5    which is exactly when   p   is a multiple of   5    similarly  if   2q 4   ends in   2    so   q   is not a multiple of   5     the possibilities for the final digit of   p 4   2q 4   are    0  mbox  or   1  mbox  or   5  mbox  or   6   2   2  mbox  or   3  mbox  or   7  mbox  or   8    so it canâ  t be equal to   5r 4    which ends in   0   or   5     therefore  if   p 4   2q 4   5r 4    we must have   p   and   q   both being multiples of   5    now as in part  i   we write   p   5a   and   q   5b    where   a   and   b   are both integers  to get    5a  4   2 5b  4   5r 4    dividing both sides by   5   gives   5 3a 4   2 5 3b 4   r 4    where we are using dot to mean multiplication  so as before    r 4   must be a multiple of   5   as the left hand side is   5 5 2a 4   2 5 2b 4     thus  since   5   is prime    r   itself must be divisible by   5    then writing   r   5c   gives   5 3a 4   2 5 3b 4    5c  4    which yields   a 4   2b 4   5c 4   on dividing by   5 3    so once again  if   p      q      r   give an integer solution to the equation  then so do   a    frac p  5       b    frac q  5    and   c    frac r  5     repeating this  so are    frac p  5 n        frac q  5 n        frac r  5 n

are you sure that it works  there are some hints below that might help you to structure your proof  but do try to come up with your own ideas before you look below  you should be really careful that you use only facts about primes and integers that you can prove for yourself  otherwise you run the risk of having a circular argument  you use some fact to prove your conjecture in this question  and then use the result in this question to prove that fact     tip  hereâ  s some conventional notation that you might find useful while working on this problem  if   a   and   b   are integers  then we

try to prove  if   p   is prime and   p   divides   ab    then   p   divides   a   or   p   divides   b     note that â  orâ   in maths is inclusive  so you should read the conclusion above as â    p

then we are done  the result is true  so we may assume that statement   y   is false  and then our job is to show that statement   z   is true  in our case  that means that our strategy is to assume that   p   is prime  that   p   divides   ab    and that   p   does not divide   a    and then to deduce that   p   divides   b     hint 3 a possible response   if youâ  re following the strategy suggested in the possible answer to hint 2 above  then you are making the extra assumption that   p   does not divide   a    how can we use that information to help      we know that   p   is prime and that   p   does not divide   a    that tells us that the highest common factor of   a   and   p   is   1    that is  they are coprime   the statement that two numbers have highest common factor   1   can be quite a negative statement  they donâ  t have any higher common factors   so can be quite difficult to work with  but fortunately we have a way to turn that into a more positive statement  we know that if the highest common factor of two numbers is   1    then we can write   1   as a linear combination of them   you might have found this while working on the open ended investigation at

there is a prime factorisation   and uniqueness  the prime factorisation is unique   both parts are useful in all sorts of places  the existence part is useful because it tells us that the primes are somehow the â  building blocksâ   from which all integers are made  and this helps with lots of things  the uniqueness part is useful because it allows us to do certain things that would otherwise not be possible  for example  if we know the prime factorisation of   n    then we know the prime factorisation of   n 2    safe in the knowledge that   n 2   canâ  t also have some other prime factorisation  note that the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is one good reason why itâ  s convenient to define   1   not to be a prime  if it were prime  then we could include as many factors of   1   as we liked in the prime factorisation of a number to get lots of different  but not interestingly different  factorisations   the statements below can be sorted into a proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic  you might want to print them out and cut them up to rearrange them   say   n   p_1  dotsm p_k   q_1  dotsm q_l    where   p_1    â      p_k      q_1    â      q_l   are primes  not necessarily distinct   then we can cancel these primes from the products   uniqueness  so   n   is composite  say   n   ab   with   1  lt  a      b  lt  n     since   q_1    â      q_l   are prime

the case of shapes drawn on the two dimensional plane the operations we are interested in are those that move a shape without changing distances between points  we have already met three types of such rigid motions  reflections  rotations and translations  moving an object along in a certain direction and by a certain distance   and this is almost all there is  in two dimensions the only remaining one describes the symmetry of a line of footprints in the sand  in this case the picture remains the same when you translate it by a certain amount and then reflect it in the line running horizontally between your foot prints  this type of rigid motion is called a glide reflection   footprints  we usually think of symmetry as something we can see  something associated with patterns and shapes  but the more general concept of symmetryâ  immunity to changeâ  means that all sorts of other objects can be symmetric too  including mathematical expressions  think for example of the expression   7x 6 10x 4 4x 2 1    itâ  s complicated  but because all the powers involved are even  its value is the same for both   x   and    x    the expression is symmetric with respect to the transformation   x

found such a value  its negative also gives you an answer to your problem  the symmetry also means that when sketching the graph of the function   f x  7x 6 10x 4 4x 2 1   you only need to work out its shape for non negative values of   x   and the rest follows  the graph  which is again a visual object  is symmetric under reflection in the   y   axis   graph  problems too can contain symmetries  for example  suppose you are given a 3    times   3 grid and you are asked to put the numbers 0 and 1 into the cells so that no two rows are the same and no two columns are the same  there is an

laws of nature  such as those describing how gravity works  are symmetric under translations in space  whether you drop an apple here  in hawaii  or 2000 light years away  the same laws can be used to

mathematics clearance 0      tube map pervasive ideas resource types contributor s guide         the bigger picture stopping safely    quadratic equations lie at the heart of many classical dynamics problems  the most basic equation of motion states that speed is equal to distance travelled divided by time  so if you travel   s   metres in   t   seconds  then your average speed is   v  frac s  t     if you are moving at a constant speed with no forces acting upon you  this equation is all you need  but what if some external force is acting  such as gravity on a falling body  or friction from the brake pads of a car on the spinning wheels  we know from newtonâ  s famous laws of motion that a constant force will cause an object to accelerate    f ma    where   f   is the force    m   is the objectâ  s mass and   a   is the acceleration  so if you are moving at a speed   u   and a force acts on you in the direction of your motion  then after   t   seconds your speed is   v u at   qquad 1    when you are accelerating  your speed is changing with time  our original equation for speed    v    frac s  t     would now only give us the average speed we have travelled  to get our instantaneous speed we need to think of speed as the rate of change of distance with time    v  frac ds  dt      with this new definition of speed we can integrate equation    1     with respect to time  to get the distance you have travelled in   t   seconds    s ut  frac 1  2 at 2   qquad 2    here we have the quadratic equation that underlies acceleration  first written down by galileo in the   17   mathrm th     century  but this is not old mathematics  it has been used continually over the last four hundred years to understand how things move in the world around us  a very modern example is calculating the stopping distances of cars  when you apply the brakes on your car it translates into a braking force  roughly equivalent to a constant  around   a 4  mathrm ms    2    in many cars   how long will it take you to stop  if you are travelling at speed   u    the question is how long will it take you to decelerate to   v 0  mathrm ms    1     a full stop  from our equation    1    above    0 u at     we have reversed the sign in front of   a   since the car is decelerating   and so the time to stop is   t   frac u  a     we can substitute this expression for   t   into our quadratic equation    2    to give the stopping distance for a braking car    s   frac u 2  a   frac 1  2  left   frac u  a  right  2     frac u 2  2a     this is another quadratic equation  this time for the stopping distance in terms of speed  and this quadratic equation is very revealing  your stopping distance increases with the square of your speedâ  double your speed and you quadruple your stopping distance  from this quadratic equation it is easier to understand why speed limits are set lower in built up areas  this is also the same quadratic equation that  together with some extra information about the road surface and car  allows road crash investigators to estimate the speed of vehicles from the length of their skid marks  accurate aim so far weâ  ve seen how a quadratic equation describes how things accelerate in the presence of a constant force  but in our example above we looked at the simplified case when the force was acting in the direction of motion  what happens more generally  there is more to motion than just speed  there is also the direction in which you are moving  these two pieces of information are combined into velocity  a vector which has both a magnitude  representing the speed  and a direction  suppose you throw a ball to your friend in the park  when the ball leaves your hand its velocity can be thought of as a combination of horizontal speed    u     which weâ  ll think of as movement in the   x   direction   and vertical speed    v     movement in the   y   direction   then  ignoring wind resistance  the ballâ  s horizontal speed will remain constant and the horizontal distance the ball travels in   t   seconds is    x ut    but in the vertical direction the ball feels the force of gravity as an acceleration of   g approx9 8  mathrm ms    2    downward  so we can again use equation    2    to give the vertical position of the ball after   t   seconds as    y vt  frac 1  2 gt 2    we can rearrange these to give    y  left  frac v  u  right x  frac 1  2u 2 gx 2    this quadratic equation describes the motion of any object that is affected by a constant force  plotting this reveals the beautiful parabolic shape of any such trajectory   figure 1  we see parabolas  the physical representation of quadratic equations  around us every day  say when you throw a ball in the park  or in the fall of a water fountain  but these quadratic equations have more deadly uses  they have been the basis for artillery calculations for centuries  power of parabolas parabolas have been fascinating mathematicians for millennia since they were first discovered by the greeks around 300bc  parabolas are one of the types of curves that result from slicing through a double cone  called the conic sections  you can read more about conic sections here   the other conic sections are circles  ellipses and hyperbolas  you can draw these using their geometric definitions in terms of the distance of these curves to their foci  to draw a circle you have a loop of string between the centre of the circle and your pencil  moving your pencil around keeping the string taut  an ellipse can be drawn in a similar way  except this time the loop of string goes around the two foci and your pencil  the same method works theoretically for the parabola  only this time your loop of string has to go around the two foci of the parabola and your pencil  the only problem being that the second focus of the parabola is infinitely far from the first  as not many people have an infinitely long piece of string handy  we can instead think of the loop from infinity coming in as a straight line parallel to the axis of symmetry   figure2  this focussing property of the parabola has some very useful consequences  any line entering the parabola  parallel to the axis of symmetry  will be reflected off the parabola to the focus  this is the reason satellite dishes are parabolic in shapeâ  any signals effectively come from infinity  so they hit the dish parallel to its axis and are reflected to the satellite receiver placed at the focus of the parabola  the same principle works in the reverse way  any lines from the focus of a parabola will be reflected off the curve as a line parallel to the axis  car headlights use this property by placing the bulb at the focus of a parabolic mirror  the mirror reflecting all the light rays from the bulb directly forward in front of the headlight parallel to the parabolaâ  s axis  this power of parabolas has been used for centuries  lighthouses traditionally used parabolic mirrors to turn the light from a lantern into a beam  and even as far back as the   3   mathrm rd     century bc  the mathematician archimedes designed a weapon that reflected the light from the sun off a parabolic arrangement of mirrors to focus the heat onto an enemyâ  s ship  it is clear that quadratic equations and their parabolic shape are very powerful  with great power comes great responsibilityâ   use them wisely        last updated 07 feb 2014 draft'),(1265,'http://cmep.maths.org/fenman/resources/bad-missingLayout1/index.html','','cmep tube        introductions  for students

md usually does not contain an index  though it might  on the website the different  md files are combined into one index html where each file is shown as a tab  to refer to other tabs you will  when this is implemented  be able to append  tabn to the url n is the tab number  counting from 0  to build the cmep content we use pandoc  a compiler that can convert markdown to a large number of other document formats  to preview your work youâ  ll need a copy of pandoc installed  together with a good text editor â   we recommend using sublime text 2  preliminary installations follow the links for downloads and installation instructions   pandoc installation  do make sure that you have the resulting pandoc executable in your path  when this is right  executing the command pandoc at a console will run the program â   it will sit there waiting for input  type ctrl d to give it an end of file to finish  sublime text 2  itâ  s useful to configure your editor so you can use pandoc to compile html previews  hereâ  s how to do it in sublime text    install the package controller for sublime  the console is available on the view  gt  show console menu in sublime  this plugin adds a number of package installation commands to sublime  which show up in the command palette when you start typing â  package controlâ    find them in the tools  gt  command palette menu    use your new package installer to install the package pandoc  markdown   this will install commands in the tools menu of sublime which compile and preview markdown  provided pandoc is in your path  these should work    enabling maths rendering in preview   on the menu go to sublime text 2  gt  preferences  gt  browse packages  this will open a window on a folder containing all your sublime packages    find the folder called pandoc  markdown  and open it    edit the python file â  pandocrender pyâ   carefully   locate a line that says cmd append    standalone   insert after it a line that says cmd append    mathjax      save  quit sublime  and restart  maths should now render in pandoc html preview    extra instructions for windows machines   in a command prompt  get the path to pandoc using  where pandoc   open sublime  open a markdown file  and check that sublime thinks it is editing markdown by checking the indicator at bottom right of the window    in the menu  go to preferences  gt  package

with doubled backslashes       save    the pandoc commands should then work  the pandoc maths commands should work after a pandoc restart  starting to write most of the things youâ  ll need are in our markdown guide guide and there is a lot more to boot in the pandoc user guide  a good place to start is with the top of the file  which contains the metadataâ   creating metadata  warning  gt  pandoc now supports its own flavour of yaml metadata  please ignore the pandoc user guideâ  s description of its metadata  we do things slightly differently   at the top of the index md file  and other  md files  which have slightly different metadata  in your resource folder there is space for some metadata  it begins with 4 backticks     at the start of the first line  and ends with 4 more backticks  between the two sets of backticks you can add data about the resource  the following template may be handy   alias   the name that appears in a tab in a multipart resource  e g   problem    solution   weight  determines the order of this part in a multipart tab bar  larger numbers come later  id   optional   can omit if same as filename and url  title   optional  but may be identified by resource

generated    the language for metadata is yaml  look it up if you must  but itâ  s simple enough to pick up by looking at a few examples  you need to be careful if your metadata value contains single or double quotes or colons  a value containing single quotes must be wrapped in double quotes  if it contains double quotes  wrap it in single quotes  if it contains a colon  wrap it in either single or double quotes  the paper copy our system uses pandoc and latex to produce pdfs of certain resources  these are designed to be printed on paper and have much of the interactive content disabled for this reason  donâ  t be afraid to use interactive content  we love it  just donâ  t expect paper users of cmep to enjoy it quite so much  submitting your resource email the folder to vicky  vrn20 cam ac uk  you might be contacted with questions and suggestions from the technical team as they test the resource to make sure it appears correctly    ã  provisional documentation these guides appear only at clearance 0 and below  they are the best we have as they demonstrate the features they are documenting  features with working examples are safe to use now  however not all the examples are working yet  and some only work in html or only in printables  and some will change their behaviour shortly  if markup requirements change we ll rework the site sources to keep them current  at present  you will need to refer to this changing document frequently   intro to markdown content for cmep is written in markdown  this is a way of providing formatting information to the layout engines without too much visual â  noiseâ    below are examples of the markdown we encourage  with some advice about how to use it  this file is written in exemplary cmep markdown style so look at its source for guidance if you like  there is more information about the pandoc variant of markdown on the pandoc website  the metadata the first thing in your file is the metadata  this is explained in the introduction   warning ignore the pandoc user guide documentation on metadata   pandoc now supports yaml metadata at the top of markdown files in a very similar manner  and this is documented in the pandoc user guide  pandoc metadata starts with 3 dashes      and ends with either 3 dashes     or 3 dots      cmep metadata starts and finishes with 4 back ticks       starting the resource on the website the top of the page gets a header  and below that go some words indicating the type of your resource  provided you put the metadata down  that is   and  if necessary  a tab bar to allow navigating the pages in the resource  headings for longer resources  such as this one  you might want to structure things with headings  in markdown use hashes     to make headings of various levels  and leave a blank line before the start of a new heading     a top level heading     a level 2 heading      a level 3 heading  which appear as  a top level heading a level 2 heading a level 3 heading please refrain from using too many levels  the latex output will not be as intended if you use level 4 or below  links use the markdown syntax for internal links â   square brackets wrapping the linked text  and parentheses wrapping the url   link text  link url   when referring to other resources on cmep  use relative urls  to refer to other files in your resource folder  simply use the filename  the site home is at        the g2 station will be at        stations g2 html  and so on  so from your resource to resource g2_rt4 goes like this   link text     g2_rt4 index html  from resource to station g2 would be    link text        stations g2 html   non local resources should be given their full url using an xref lodash tag  like this   lt    xref â  pierre de fermatâ    â  http   www history mcs st and ac uk biographies fermat htmlâ      gt  including images similar rules apply when providing the url for an image file  but you will want to make sure the image is optimised for the web and available locally  remember also  that paper versions of your resource will require much higher resolution images for good quality reproduction  for this reason  vector graphics are preferred for web and paper  they â  look rightâ   with very little extra effort  the problem is that youâ  ll need  for now at least  to supply pdf and svg versions of your file  soon we hope to have a converter and then everyone can just supply lovely svg images  the free graphics editor inkscape might be useful for this  or even just a text editor  if you must go for bitmap  note that we would like images at 600 pixels per inch for paper  144 pixels per inch for high resolution screens  72 for the more usual displays  if you provide the highest resolution you might need  the site build process can convert to the needed format  the best graphics format depends on the image  24 bit png is a good all round option that allows transparency if itâ  s needed  8 bit png is good for simple diagrams with few colours  jpeg files are usually much smaller than 24 bit pngs for photographs  paragraph styling markdown is quite limited and beyond inline emphasis  _emphasis_  you canâ  t style the text  that is why we have our own syntax for special things  using lodash templates  itâ  s explained in the lodash guide  you might be tempted to use html snippets which seem to work fine  that is until our latex processor gets hold of the pageâ    if you would like a style that isnâ  t in the lodash library please ask and weâ  ll try to accomodate something  line breaks you probably donâ  t want hard line breaks most of the time  use a blank line to indicate a paragraph break  if you must have a hard line break  the equivalent of the latex      please use the pandoc syntax  backslash newline rather than the standard trailing double space  as the latter is easy to miss  lists markdown can use any of      or   to mark bullet lists  we prefer to use   for consistency across the resources  see the pandoc website for more details about lists  the official spacing rules are also relatively relaxed  but we will use a slightly stricter rule to avoid making other errors later on and potential clashes with lodash expansions  put the item marker in the first column with no space before it  all content starts in the fifth column  so that any further paragraphs in the same bullet point  indented by four spaces  will begin in the same column   in sublists  these will all be indented four or eight spaces to indicate that they are within a higher level item   for example  this is the house style for a list with a sublist   1   this is a list item       within this list is a sublist           first bullet          second bullet           more in the second bullet          third bullet   todo  write about links  tables  etc  etc  mathematics to write mathematics use latex notation  actually  that part of latex which is supported by both pandoc and the service â   which is more than enough to support school mathematics  assume the amsmath package is installed  but little else  delimit inline mathematics with single dollar signs as in  y x 2   which will display as   y x 2    delimit display mathematics with double dollars as in   y  frac 1  x 2     which will display on a separate centred line as   y  frac 1  x 2     do not place a blank line before or after    unless you intend the paragraph to begin or end at that point  leaving blank lines in other cases will cause poorly formatted pdf documents to be created  note that   and    are the only mathematics delimiters that are recognised by code running in the browser  anything in between is assumed to be valid tex or latex in a mathematics context  equation environments itâ  s a bit of a mess  to be honest  pandoc is not great with this  almost none of the amsmath environments work with pandoc  as pandoc requires them to be wrapped in    within markdown  but latex requires them not to be  almost the only known way to have working aligned equations is to do the following      begin aligned  a  amp    n 1  2      amp   n 2   n   n   1      amp   n 2   2n   1  end aligned     please donâ  t try other thingsâ  they simply donâ  t work  either the latex crashes or the html doesnâ  t display the maths     ã  provisional documentation these guides appear only at clearance 0 and below  they are the best we have as they demonstrate the features they are documenting  features with working examples are safe to use now  however not all the examples are working yet  and some only work in html or only in printables  and some will change their behaviour shortly  if markup requirements change we ll rework the site sources to keep them current  at present  you will need to refer to this changing document frequently   lodash markup markdown isnâ  t quite rich enough to do all that we want  we occasionally need extra markup to insert new styles  interactive elements  or to echo some metadata within the page  the main thing to know is that we use special tags   lt      gt  or even  lt     gt  to construct this extra markup  this markup is implemented using the lodash template library  the tags with the equals sign  namely  lt      gt  interpolate the code inside  it runs the javascript code inside and the result appears in place of the whole tag  this is useful for metadata  styles and other things that need to provide some output  we provide a set of javascript variables and functions that can be included to do useful things  and these can be extended as necessary  the tags without the equals sign  namely  lt     gt  evaluate the code inside  and wonâ  t automatically make output  this is ideal for logical statements which control what gets displayed  examples are below to explain this difference  note that sections enclosed between lodash markers  for example the â  chalkâ   style described below  must not be indented any more than the surrounding block  otherwise the html generation fails   markdown regards initial white space as significant   for example  the following is correct layout  though the lodash markup has been written with an extra space between the â   lt â   and the â   â   to prevent it from being compiled     a   this is the start of a list      remember that markdown lists are indented by four spaces

lodash markup can do javascript logic  itâ  s best shown by example  the current clearance is 1 and this resource has clearance  1  we can include content based on the global clearance with the following syntax   lt   if  clearance     1      gt  this text will only be seen when the content is processed with clearance  1   lt     else     gt  this text will be seen otherwise   lt       gt  which provides the following output  this text will be seen otherwise  itâ  s important to get the brackets  braces and tags correct  web and print interactive content can be ignored entirely  or somehow handled specially in print  toggle buttons and collapsed blocks these are linked to the collapsed content with which they share an id number   lt    collapsed n    gt  starts a collapsed block identified by n   lt    collapsed     gt  ends a collapsed block   lt    toggle n  â  labelâ    type    gt     n is the id number referencing the content to be revealed or hidden     label  is the button label   it must be quoted    type is a bootstrap button type which changes the button colour   it need not be quoted  the types are    no type parameter present   grey   primary   blue   info   cyan   warning   orange   danger   red   success   green   inverse   white text on black   link   appear as a hyperlink  a default button  some hidden content  press the default button again to hide   a primary button  some hidden content  press the primary button again to hide   an info button  hidden info  press the info button again to hide   a warning button  a hidden warning  press the warning button again to hide   a danger button  a hidden danger  press the danger button again to hide   a success button  a hidden success  press the success button again to hide   an inverse button  press the inverse button again to hide   a link button  press the link button again to hide   hint answer bar the code  lt    hintanswerbar n  â  hlabelâ    alabelâ      gt  where n is a positive integer  makes a pair of buttons labelled with hlabel and alabel  clicking them reveals sections with id â  hintnâ   and â  answernâ   which must be defined elsewhere  if you have more than one hintanswerbar on a page  make sure to choose a different n for each one  in print  the hint answer bar makes a subsection labelled with the hlabel  containing the hint  the answer is given in a footnote  because of this  the answer text must be a single paragraph  though it may contain hard line breaks  the hint answer bar connects to its content by the number n  this must therefore be unique on the page  the content may appear anywhere on the page  to define the content use   lt    hint n    gt  this is text displayed when the hint button in hintanswerbar n is clicked  lt    hint     gt   lt    answer n    gt  this is text displayed when the answer button in hintanswerbar n is clicked  the answer must currently be written as one paragraph   i e   160 with no empty lines  if you wish to break it up  you can use the pandoc technique to force a hard line break by ending a line with a backslash   lt    answer     gt  multiple hint answer groups can appear on the page  but the ids must be chosen uniquely for them to work as intended  an example appears at resource na3_rt5_2  a possible approach which might lead here   you could press the answer button now     which might reveal this   icons  lt    icon name    gt  inserts an icon by quoted name  the names are listed on the bootstrap site  but drop the leading â  icon â   part  for example   lt    icon â  fileâ      gt  will produce   lodash hyperlinking commands you will normally only need to use standard markdown to make hyperlinks and to include images  however  if to link to an external site that should appear in its own tab or window  use  lt    xref text  url    gt   urls must be either page relative urls or external http urls  for example  use    g2_rt2 index html to reference that resource from another one  urls must be quoted  image references are similar  if you simply want to include an image from the same folder  just give the filename  image links  lt    imagelink image  text  url    gt  embeds the image file   captioned with the quoted text  and hyperlinks it to the url  the image must be available to the siteâ  s build system if itâ  s to appear in printable pdfs   lt    imagelink â  swanage pngâ    â  swanageâ    â  http   en wikipedia org wiki swanageâ      gt    swanage   iframe embeds  lt    iframe text  url  width  height  image â  thumbnail pngâ      gt  inserts an iframe in html  or the thumbnail image in pdf  url is the url of the page to be inserted in the iframe  the iframe box size is specified in pixels by width and height  in pdf  width and height are ignored  and the thumbnail image is reproduced at its natural size  and the alternate text is reproduced   lt    iframe â  swanage tubemapâ    â  https   cmep maths org swanage map htmlâ    500  300  image â  swanage pngâ      gt  will generate the following iframe  example commented out for now due to chrome cookie issue   button links  lt    buttonlink type  text  url  print false    gt  inserts a button of the given unquoted type  labelled with the quoted text  which will follow the link to the quoted url  print may be omitted  in which case the button will be invisible in the pdf  if print is set to true  the button displays as a textlink in the pdf  for example   lt    buttonlink info  â  swanage againâ    â  https   cmep maths org swanageâ      gt  yields swanage again  embedded audio  lt    audio url  controls true autoplay false loop false     gt  inserts an audio player  with default options   examples examples    lt    audio â  https   archive org download wilhelmscreamsample wilhelmscream_64kb

loads a page that never stops screaming    embedded video  lt    video url  controls true autoplay false loop false     gt  inserts an audio player  with default options   debugging lodash commands save often and check that the html view looks reasonable  certain errors cause all the lodash markdown on a page to fail  and so they can be difficult to find if you have made many changes  weâ  re working on making the error reporting better  if you do get into the situation where nothing appears to work the best plan currently is to use html comments to comment out large sections of the text  that way you can move the commented section around to narrow the problem down to its source    ã  provisional documentation these guides appear only at clearance 0 and below  they are the best we have as they demonstrate the features they are documenting  features with working examples are safe to use now  however not all the examples are working yet  and some only work in html or only in printables  and some will change their behaviour shortly  if markup requirements change we ll rework the site sources to keep them current  at present  you will need to refer to this changing document frequently   the cmep house style we should aim for consistency  so that our site has a uniform feel and users get used to it  here are some things to bear in mind  letâ  s write e g   160 and i e   not eg or ie  we have points of inflection rather than points of inflexion  pronouns wherever possible  please use â  weâ    â  ourâ    â  usâ    etc   rather than â  youâ    as it feels more inclusive  we might predict  we can use this to understand  take our function  etc  numbers where numbers are mathematical  as opposed to dates  for example   please enclose them in dollars  even if itâ  s just a number with no other mathematical symbols  for example  i might list a sequence   1      2      3    â    or i might talk about   90   degrees  but iâ  d talk about 180bc or 10th january 2014  letâ  s not use commas in numbers  so 1000000 rather than 1 000 000   fractions within a line  between single dollars   it may be clearer to write  1 2  rather than   frac 1  2    but when using double dollars please go for the  frac variety unless thereâ  s a good reason to do otherwise  dashes for text enclosed between dashesâ  like this bitâ  please use three dashes with no spaces  no spaces between dashes  no spaces between words and dashes   things like this   it s very simple  the same applies for explanatory remarks after dashesâ  like this one  for dashes showing ranges  such as   10  â    20   or 2013â  2014  please use two dashes with no spaces  so  10    20  or 2013  2014     ellipsis for â    please use the following  just within text  type      in a maths expression with a binary operator  use  dotsb  as in   1   2    dotsb   n    in a maths expression with multiplication  you can also use  dotsm  as in   1  times 2  times  dotsm  times n    in a maths expression with commas  use  dotsc  as in    1  2   dotsc  n     horizontal lines we can get a stylish horizontal line like this  by typing a blank line  a line with three asterisks  and then another blank line  this is good for separating bits of a solution that refer to different parts of a question  for example  images if you want a captioned image  remember to leave a blank line above and below the image markdown and do not indent its markdown  for example      a demented goose  https   0 gravatar com avatar 7d50863de4f9b22f19c71b501f09ff86    will generate a centered image  captioned â  a demented gooseâ     a demented goose  if you include any other text on the same line as the image markdown  or fail to leave spaces  then the image will be treated as an inline imageâ  for example    a demented goose  https   0 gravatar com avatar 7d50863de4f9b22f19c71b501f09ff86   this can occasionally be what you need  for example    image sizes  names  and formats if possible please create your source images in svg using an editor such as inkscape  set the document size to be 3 times the size that it should appear on screen  typically  somewhere between 300px and 500px wide is usually good for screen  so your svg image size should be between 900px and 1500px wide  your svg images are scalable  but these pixel dimensions will determine the size of bitmaps that are created from them when we build the site  and this in turn will determine how big the image appears in screen and print once we stop rescaling images in these media  which we will  promise  keep your source images in a subfolder called sourcesâ  for exampleresources g2_rt2 sources diagram1 svg  if you need to create a screen snapshot or a bitmap image for any reason  then create it at print resolutionâ  3 times the

preamble  students rapidly get engaged with the task  which then gives them an opportunity to discover the relevant ideas or concepts for themselves  perhaps by working collaboratively with others  this might well be followed by some sort of summary  or exposition  or worked examples  to formalise what has been found       introductory problem    a task that gets students started on the sort of thinking or mathematics in a section of work  but that is perhaps less open and exploratory than an introductory investigation       exposition    a presentation of some mathematics  perhaps in the form of an article or a video  it might  but need not  include questions for the student to consider while reading watching the presentation       worked examples    an illustration of a standard technique  or a standard way of presenting an argument  for example  through carefully chosen examples  crucially the worked examples are followed by problems for students to try themselves  and while these problems are related to the worked examples  they require more than just  templating   changing a few numbers in the worked examples   another sort of resource in this category could be an invitation to the student to come up with their own examples  as a way of getting a feel for the scope of an idea or technique       scaffolded task    a task that gives students an opportunity to engage with material that would otherwise be out of their grasp  for example  it might be a  proof sorter  activity that enables students to understand the components of a proof and their ordering  although creating the proof from scratch would be beyond the students  or it might be a  hide and reveal  task  which has a number of sections that can be revealed one at a time  to offer some structure  e g  subtasks leading to a big task  that helps students to make progress on something that would otherwise be too big or demanding       problem inviting multiple approaches or representations    students sometimes seize the first idea that comes to mind  when it might not necessarily be the most effective  these problems draw students  attention to the thought that there might be several ways to tackle a problem  or to represent an idea  they might do this not only by setting a problem that can be tackled in several ways  but also by illustrating some of these ways  or suggesting several starting points       carefully designed set of problems    this is a set of problems that have been designed and that should be thought of as a single entity  it might be that the problems build on each other  so that by the end they are requiring more sophistication but in a way that is accessible to students who have worked through the whole set  or it might be that by working on all of the problems  the student is naturally prompted to explore some underlying structure or to make a generalisation       problem requiring decisions    students are often used to problems being posed in such a way that they have all the information that they require for a solution  and no more  problems  especially from the real world  are very often not like this  and so resources of this type will give students the opportunity to develop the skills needed to deal with this  some problems might not contain enough information to answer a question  and so students will have to find some additional information  perhaps by making assumptions  perhaps by asking an expert  teacher   perhaps by carrying out an experiment  perhaps by researching online   and some problems might contain too much data  so that part of the challenge is to identify the useful information       open ended investigation    something for students to get stuck into  it might start with just an interesting context  or with some initial questions to explore  but the emphasis is on students posing their own questions  and pursuing the avenues that interest them  this is good for developing various mathematical skills  and gives students the opportunity to work on things that really inspire them  these investigations might be good for after school clubs  or individual projects       fluency exercises    a bank of routine exercises  perhaps randomly generated  that students can use to develop fluency  students can be encouraged to do as many as they need to do to feel confident and fluent with a particular idea or technique       lucky dip    a mixed collection of problems for further practice  students  or teachers  might pick a problem at random  or might rummage through the bag to find a problem that appeals to them  working on these problems is not necessary for understanding the topic  but it is useful to have these problems available for additional practice and for variety  many of them might be fairly short       review questions    students will regularly want to test their understanding  both of a particular topic and of their ability to draw together ideas from a number of topics  review questions might include some past examination questions  alongside other fairly closed problems and other problems designed to get students to look back over what they have learned  they might be pitched at different levels  and might be flagged to show whether they incorporate ideas from other topics       go and think about it       a problem for which students  probably  have the required mathematical knowledge  but where the challenge is identifying how to get started  what tools might help  and how to apply the relevant mathematical knowledge  students might tackle such a problem at home  for a challenge  as these problems are often more suited for individual consideration than classroom collaboration       the bigger picture    a resource that puts the mathematics into context  perhaps by offering a historical perspective  or describing the mathematicians who worked on it  or linking it to areas of current research  or illustrating how it leads on to further topics  e g  at university level   they would not all need to be accessible to all students  sometimes it might be appropriate to have something that is designed for a student with a particular interest  e g  for a student with an interest in physics  who is studying a level physics alongside maths   this sort of resource might be an article or video  for example  it might  but need not  contain questions for the student to consider while reading or watching ');
